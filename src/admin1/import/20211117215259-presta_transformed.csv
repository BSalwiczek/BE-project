Students will learn how to write custom Java classes and methods, and how to test their code using unit testing and test-driven development.  Topics include basic data structures like Arrays and ArrayLists and overloading methods. Subtitles: English Subtitles: English The University of Pennsylvania (commonly referred to as Penn) is a private university, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. A member of the Ivy League, Penn is the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, and considers itself to be the first university in the United States with both undergraduate and graduate studies.  Welcome to Java! This first module provides an introduction to the Java language and object-oriented programming. It includes an overview of Java syntax, in particular, how it differs from a language like Python. Topics will include variables and data types, loops and conditionals, printing to the console, scanning for user input, and code documentation. This module also explains the structure and inner-workings of a Java class and teaches you how to define your own custom classes and methods. In this module, you will be taught to test your code to get it working. The best way to do this is to write a set of unit tests that you can run against your program, at any time. In this module, we'll learn how to do unit testing in Java, and why we want to do it. We’ll also learn all about Java Arrays, which are collections of items, and ArrayLists, which are kind of like arrays, but much more flexible. These work just like lists in Python. ArrayLists are part of Java’s larger Collections Framework, which we’ll continue to reference throughout this course. So far, we’ve been defining variables as instance variables in our Java classes. Instance variables are just variables defined inside a class, and every instance of a class can have a different value for an instance variable. In this module, we’ll look at defining static variables in our Java classes. Static variables are also defined as variables inside a class, but with the keyword 'static'. Static variables have the same value for every instance of a class. In fact, you don’t even need to create an instance of a class to use a static variable! We’ll also look at static methods. And just like static variables, you don’t need to create an instance of a class to use, or call, a static method. In this module, we’re also going to introduce polymorphism, which refers to overloading and overriding. We’ll focus on overloading, which is having two or more methods in the same class, with the same name. This Specialization starts out by teaching basic concepts in Python and ramps up to more complex subjects such as object-oriented programming and data structures in Java. By the time learners complete this series of four courses, they will be able to write fully-functional programs in both Python and Java, two of the most well-known and frequently used programming languages in the world today. Introduction to Programming with Python and Java is for students and professionals who have minimal or no prior programming exposure. It’s for motivated learners who have experience with rigorous coursework, and are looking to gain a competitive edge in advancing their career. It’s for folks who are thinking about applying to the University of Pennsylvania’s online Master of Computer and Information Technology degree and want to sample some of the lecture videos and content from the first course in the program. We hope this Specialization is for you.  Topics in this Specialization include language syntax, style, programming techniques, and coding conventions. Learn about best practices and good code design, code testing and test-driven development, code debugging, code and program documentation, and computational thinking. ;10;1;1;Długość kursu:3h:1|2;Java

It is one of the eight universities of the Ivy League, and one of the nine Colonial Colleges founded before the American Revolution. Welcome to Algorithms, Part I. We illustrate our basic approach to developing and analyzing algorithms by considering the dynamic connectivity problem. We introduce the union−find data type and consider several implementations (quick find, quick union, weighted quick union, and weighted quick union with path compression). Finally, we apply the union−find data type to the percolation problem from physical chemistry. The basis of our approach for analyzing the performance of algorithms is the scientific method. We begin by performing computational experiments to measure the running times of our programs. We use these measurements to develop hypotheses about performance. Next, we create mathematical models to explain their behavior. Finally, we consider analyzing the memory usage of our Java programs. We consider two fundamental data types for storing collections of objects: the stack and the queue. We implement each using either a singly-linked list or a resizing array. We introduce two advanced Java features—generics and iterators—that simplify client code. Finally, we consider various applications of stacks and queues ranging from parsing arithmetic expressions to simulating queueing systems. We introduce the sorting problem and Java's Comparable interface. We study two elementary sorting methods (selection sort and insertion sort) and a variation of one of them (shellsort). We also consider two algorithms for uniformly shuffling an array. We conclude with an application of sorting to computing the convex hull via the Graham scan algorithm. We study the mergesort algorithm and show that it guarantees to sort any array of n items with at most n lg n compares. We also consider a nonrecursive, bottom-up version. We prove that any compare-based sorting algorithm must make at least  n lg n compares in the worst case. We discuss using different orderings for the objects that we are sorting and the related concept of stability. We introduce and implement the randomized quicksort algorithm and analyze its performance. We also consider randomized quickselect, a quicksort variant which finds the kth smallest item in linear time. Finally, we consider 3-way quicksort, a variant of quicksort that works especially well in the presence of duplicate keys. We introduce the priority queue data type and an efficient implementation using the binary heap data structure. This implementation also leads to an efficient sorting algorithm known as heapsort. We conclude with an applications of priority queues where we simulate the motion of n particles subject to the laws of elastic collision.  We define an API for symbol tables (also known as associative arrays, maps, or dictionaries) and describe two elementary implementations using a sorted array (binary search) and an unordered list (sequential search). When the keys are Comparable, we define an extended API that includes the additional methods min, max floor, ceiling, rank, and select. To develop an efficient implementation of this API, we study the binary search tree data structure and analyze its performance. In this lecture, our goal is to develop a symbol table with guaranteed logarithmic performance for search and insert (and many other operations). We begin with 2−3 trees, which are easy to analyze but hard to implement. Next, we consider red−black binary search trees, which we view as a novel way to implement 2−3 trees as binary search trees. Finally, we introduce B-trees, a generalization of 2−3 trees that are widely used to implement file systems. We start with 1d and 2d range searching, where the goal is to find all points in a given 1d or 2d interval. To accomplish this, we consider kd-trees, a natural generalization of BSTs when the keys are points in the plane (or higher dimensions). We also consider intersection problems, where the goal is to find all intersections among a set of line segments or rectangles. We begin by describing the desirable properties of hash function and how to implement them in Java, including a fundamental tenet known as the uniform hashing assumption that underlies the potential success of a hashing application. Then, we consider two strategies for implementing hash tables—separate chaining and linear probing. Both strategies yield constant-time performance for search and insert under the uniform hashing assumption.  We consider various applications of symbol tables including sets, dictionary clients, indexing clients, and sparse vectors. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:11h:1|2;Algorithms

El lenguaje Java es uno de los que más me ha gustado en mis 45 años que llevo programando. Si bien te podrá parecer un poco complicado empezar a programar en Java, una vez que cubras los conceptos básicos verás qué rápido se avanza. Java, como todos los lenguajes de programación bien hechos, te dejan hacer cualquier cosa (algunas de ellas con más trabajo que en otros lenguajes y otras casi directamente de cómo piensas la solución al problema).  Pero una vez que pasas esa primera etapa, programar te va a hacer sentir casi como un sacerdote de un culto extraño, que puede hacer que las cosas sucedan a placer, se vean exactamente como tú quieres y obtengas una satisfacción enorme de haber construido algo que puedes ver y repartirlo para que otros lo usen.  Este es un curso introductorio a la programación en Java. Como Java es un lenguaje orientado a objetos de propósito general, revisaremos los conceptos básicos del lenguaje como clases e interfaces. Veremos los ingredientes básicos de una clase como constantes y variables, funciones (métodos), y cómo organizar estos ingredientes dentro de una clase. También veremos la utilización de clases de las bibliotecas de Java.  En el primer módulo revisaremos el concepto de orientación a objetos aplicándolo en la vida real.  En el segundo módulo revisamos una herramienta de diseño orientado a objetos, llamada tarjetas de responsabilidades, y a partir de estas últimas diseñamos los encabezados de los distintos servicios que se van a dar, codificándolos en una interfaz.  En el tercer módulo terminaremos la construcción de la clase que corresponde a este problema, aclarando términos comunes en Java, revisando la sintaxis del lenguaje y la autodocumentación con la que cuenta.  En el cuarto módulo utilizaremos lo que ya tenemos para construir una clase más compleja que proporciones arreglos de objetos de la clase que ya tenemos y examinando con bastante profundidad tanto el esquema conceptual de los arreglos como su implementación en el modelo de memoria de Java.  En el quinto y último módulo profundizaremos en el uso de repetición en ejecución y, no puede faltar, los distintos tipos de ejecución condicional que provee el lenguaje.  En este curso, ofrecido por la UNAM, se proveerá al participante con conocimientos del lenguaje Java que le permitirán resolver una amplia gama de problemas con este lenguaje. Aprenderá a: • Plantear la solución de un problema utilizando orientación a objetos. • Programar la solución de los problemas utilizando las siguientes características del lenguaje Java:                -Interfaces y clases                -Métodos constructores de objetos, de acceso, de actualización, de implementación y auxiliares.                -Atributos y variables locales de tipos primitivos o de clase.                -Utilización de clases de biblioteca.                -Esquemas de ejecución como la repetición y la selección de enunciados                -Arreglos Subtitles: Spanish Subtitles: Spanish La Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México fue fundada el 21 de septiembre de 1551 con el nombre de la Real y Pontificia Universidad de México.

Learning to program is an essential part of the education of every student, not just in the sciences and engineering, but in the arts, social sciences, and humanities, as well. Beyond direct applications, it is the first step in understanding the nature of computer science’s undeniable impact on the modern world.  This course covers the first half of our book Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach (the second half is covered in our Coursera course Computer Science: Algorithms, Theory, and Machines). Our intent is to teach programming to those who need or want to learn it, in a scientific context.  We begin by introducing basic programming elements such as variables, conditionals, loops, arrays, and I/O. Next, we turn to functions, introducing key concepts such as recursion, modular programming, and code reuse. Then, we present a modern introduction to object-oriented programming.  We use the Java programming language and teach basic skills for computational problem solving that are applicable in many modern computing environments. Proficiency in Java is a goal, but we focus on fundamental concepts in programming, not Java per se.  All the features of this course are available for free. It does not offer a certificate upon completion.

It is one of the eight universities of the Ivy League, and one of the nine Colonial Colleges founded before the American Revolution. Why program? This lecture addresses that basic question. Then it describes the anatomy of your first program and the process of developing a program in Java using either virtual terminals or a program development environment, with some historical context. Most of the lecture is devoted to a thorough coverage of Java's built-in data types, with example programs for each. The if, while, and for statements are Java's fundamental control structures. This lecture is built around short programs that use these constructs to address important computational tasks. Examples include sorting, computing the square root, factoring, and simulating a random process. The lecture concludes with a detailed example illustrating the process of debugging a program. Computing with a large sequence of values of the same type is extremely common. This lecture describes Java's built-in array data structure that supports such applications, with several examples, including shuffling a deck of cards, the coupon collector test for randomness, and random walks in a grid. To interact with our programs, we need mechanisms for taking information from the outside world and for presenting information to the outside world. This lecture describes several such mechanisms: for text, drawings, and animation. Detailed examples covered include fractal drawings that model natural phenomena and an animation of a ball bouncing around in the display window. Modular programming is the art and science of breaking a program into pieces that can be individually developed. This lecture introduces functions (Java methods), a fundamental mechanism that enables modular programming. Motivating examples include functions for the classic Gaussian distribution and an application that creates digital music. A recursive function is one that calls itself. This lecture introduces the concept by treating in detail the ruler function and (related) classic examples, including  the Towers of Hanoi puzzle, the H-tree, and simple models of the real world based on recursion. We show a common pitfall in the use of recursion, and a simple way to avoid it, which introduces a different (related) programming paradigm known as dynamic programming. When you develop a program, you need to be aware of its resource requirements. In this lecture, we describe a scientific approach to understanding performance, where we develop mathematical models describing the running time our programs and then run empirical tests to validate them. Eventually we come to a simple and effective approach that you can use to predict the running time of your own programs that involve significant amounts of computation. In Java, you can create your own data types and use them in your programs. In this and the next lecture, we show how this ability allows us to view our programs as abstract representations of real-world concepts. First we show the mechanics of writing client programs that use data types. Our examples involve abstractions such as color, images, and genes. This style of programming is known as object-oriented programming because our programs manipulate objects, which hold data type values. Creating your own data types is the central activity in modern Java programming. This lecture covers the mechanics (instance variables, constructors, instance methods, and test clients) and then develops several examples, culminating in a program that uses a quintessential mathematical abstraction (complex numbers) to create visual representations of the famous Mandelbrot set. We conclude the course with an overview of important issues surrounding programming languages. To convince you that your knowledge of Java will enable you to learn other programming languages, we show implementations of a typical program in C, C++, Python, and Matlab. We describe important differences among these languages and address fundamental issues, such as garbage collection, type checking, object oriented programming, and functional programming with some brief historical context. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:32h:1|2;Algorithms

The university has a strong commitment to applying knowledge in service to society, both near its North Carolina campus and around the world. Welcome to “Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software”! We are excited that you are starting our course to learn how to write programs in Java, one of the most popular programming languages in the world. In this introductory module, you will get to meet the instructor team from Duke University and have an overview of the course. Have fun! In this module, you will learn to write and run your first Java programs, including one program that prints “Hello!” in various countries’ languages and another where you will analyze the perimeters and other information of shapes. To accomplish these tasks, you will learn the basics of Java syntax and how to design stepwise solutions with programs. By the end of this module, you will be able to: (1) Download and run BlueJ, the Java programming environment for this course (2) Access the documentation for the Java libraries specially designed for this course (3) Edit, compile, and run a Java program (4) Construct methods, variables, if else statements, and for each loops in Java and (5) Use Iterables (like DirectoryResource) to run a program that iterates over multiples lines in a document or webpage or multiple files in a directory. This module begins with a short presentation from Raluca Gordân, an assistant professor in Duke University’s Center for Genomic and Computational Biology, about an important problem genomics scientists encounter regularly: how to identify genes in a strand of DNA. To tackle this problem, you will need to understand strings: series of characters such as letters, digits, punctuation, etc. After learning about Java methods that work with strings, you will be able to find genes within a DNA string as well as tackle other string related problems, such as finding all of the links in a web page. By the end of this module, you will be able to: (1) Use important methods for the Java String class (2) Use conditionals, for loops, and while loops appropriately in a Java program (3) Find patterns in the data represented by strings to help develop the algorithm for your program (4) Understand the importance of designing programs that keep different data processing steps separate (5) Use the StorageResource iterable for this course to store some data for further processing and (6) Rely on Java documentation to better understand how to use different Java packages and classes. A common format for storing tabular data (any data organized into columns and rows) is in comma separated values (CSV) files. In this module, you will learn how to analyze and manipulate data from multiple CSV data files using a powerful open-source software package: Apache Commons CSV. Using this library will empower you to solve problems that could prove too complex to solve with a spreadsheet. By the end of this module, you will be able to: (1) Use the open-source Apache Commons CSV package in your own Java programs (2) Access data from one or many CSV files using Java (3) Convert strings into numbers (4) Understand how to use “null” in Java programs (when you want to represent “nothing”) (5) Devise an algorithm (and implement in Java) to answer questions about CSV data and (6) Analyze CSV data across multiple CSV files (for example, find maximums, minimums, averages, and other simple statistical results). This module wraps up the course with a mini project that ties together the different practices, skills, and libraries you have gained across the course! Using data on the popularity of different baby names in the United States from the past several decades, you will be able to compare different names’ popularity over time.

We'll go over some basics of interacting with a client when managing a web site project and then go visit a real client at their place of business (a Chinese restaurant), help the owner figure out what she wants in a site, and get acquainted with the restaurant in general. We'll spend the rest of the module building a real web site for this business from scratch and you'll get to sit next to me and watch as the site comes together. What fun would a web site be if there was no functionality to it? In this module, we are going to concentrate on learning the fundamentals of the Javascript language. A lot of even seasoned developers “tinker” with Javascript without really understanding how the language works. That leads to viewing the language as more of a nuisance instead of a powerful tool. That is why we are going to concentrate not only on the “how” but also on the “why”, so you are empowered by the Javascript language features, not confused by them. We’ll cover just about everything - from common language constructs and Javascript types to objects, functions, arrays, closures, and scope isolation. In this module, we are going to take all those newly learned Javascript language skills and learn how to utilize them within the context of a web page. We’ll start by learning how to properly manipulate the web page components using the Javascript Document Object Model API. We will then move on to learning one of the most popular ways of serving up data to a web site - Ajax. We'll learn about the protocol that the language of the web speaks in (HTTP), how to set up and handle Ajax requests and responses, as well as how to process JSON data. We'll finish the module by connecting our restaurant web site from Module 3 to a real backend service that will allow us to pull the data for the restaurant menu dynamically from the server without having to reload the entire page. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:30h:1|2;Web Development

It is one of the eight universities of the Ivy League, and one of the nine Colonial Colleges founded before the American Revolution. We begin by considering historical context and motivation for the scientific study of algorithm performance. Then we consider a classic example that illustrates the key ingredients of the process: the analysis of Quicksort. The lecture concludes with a discussion of some resources that you might find useful during this course. We begin this lecture with an overview of recurrence relations, which provides us with a direct mathematical model for the analysis of algorithms. We finish by examining the fascinating oscillatory behavior of the divide-and-conquer recurrence corresponding to the mergesort algorithm and the general master theorem for related recurrences. Since the 17th century, scientists have been using generating functions to solve recurrences, so we continue with an overview of generating functions, emphasizing their utility in solving problems like counting the number of binary trees with N nodes. Exact answers are often cumbersome, so we next consider a scientific approach to developing approximate answers that, again, mathematicians and scientists have used for centuries. Analytic Combinatorics. With a basic knowledge of recurrences, generating functions, and asymptotics, you are ready to learn and appreciate the basic features of analytic combinatorics, a systematic approach that avoids much of the detail of the classical methods that we have been considering. We introduce unlabeled and labelled combinatorial classes and motivate our basic approach to studying them, with numerous examples. The quintessential recursive structure, trees of various sorts are ubiquitous in scientific enquiry, and they arise explicitly in countless computing applications. You can find broad coverage in the textbook, but the lecture focuses on the use of analytic combinatorics to enumerate various types of trees and study parameters. The study of sorting algorithms is the study of properties of permutations. We introduce analytic-combinatoric approaches to studying permutations in the context of this relationship. From DNA sequences to web indices, strings (sequences of characters) are ubiquitous in modern computing applications, so we use analytic combinatorics to study their basic properties and then introduce the trie, an essential and fundamental structure not found in classical combinatorics. We view strings as sets of characters or as functions from [1..N] to [1..M] to study classical occupancy problems and their application to fundamental hashing algorithms. Functions from [1..N] to [1..N] are mappings, which have an interesting and intricate structure that we can study with analytic combinatorics. ;10;1;1;Długość kursu:8h:1|2;Web Development

In particular, this MOOC covers key Java programming language features that control the flow of execution through an app (such as Java’s various looping constructs and conditional statements), enable access to structured data (such as Java's built-in arrays and common classes in the Java Collections Framework, such as ArrayList and HashMap), group related operations and data into classes and interfaces (such as Java's primitive and user-defined types, fields, methods, generic parameters, and exceptions), customize the behavior of existing classes via inheritance and polymorphism (such as subclassing and overriding virtual methods). Learners will apply these Java features in the context of core Android components (such as Activities and basic UI elements) by applying common tools (such as Android Studio) needed to develop Java programs and useful Android apps.    Learners will work on several hands-on projects throughout the MOOC, i.e., each week will require learners to write solutions to programming assignments that reinforce the material covered in the lecture videos. There will be roughly 4-6 hours of student engagement time per week, including video lectures, quizzes, and programming assignments.

La construcción del modelo conceptual del mundo del problema en muchas ocasiones implica usar el concepto de colección o grupos de elementos de la misma clase, y manejar estrategias para añadir nuevos elementos a ese grupo o para buscar un elemento en particular dentro de dicha colección. En este módulo vamos a tratar algunos conceptos fundamentales de la programación que nos permiten manejar grupos de elementos: los arreglos y las matrices, que son estructuras contenedoras de 1 y 2 dimensiones. Usaremos estas entidades para representar colecciones de datos u objetos en nuestro modelo del mundo. Además, vamos a revisar las diferentes operaciones algorítmicas que podemos realizar sobre las estructuras de datos en 1 y 2 dimensiones, ya sea para agregar y eliminar elementos o para realizar tanto búsquedas como manipulaciones de los objetos contenidos allí. Tenga en cuenta que el tiempo estimado para la realización de todas las actividades de este módulo es de cerca de 16 horas, tiempo que usted puede invertir de acuerdo con sus posibilidades. Le recomendamos que desarrolle todas las actividades en el orden propuesto y que considere hacerlo en un tiempo de dos semanas. ¡Le damos la bienvenida al módulo 3! Uno de los problemas críticos que enfrentan los programadores es la eficiencia de los programas que escriben. Un usuario en general espera que el programa sea capaz de contestar sus requerimientos rápidamente. ¿Cómo construir entonces programas que sean eficientes? La respuesta a esta pregunta es bastante más difícil de contestar, puesto que intervienen muchos factores diferentes. Uno de los enfoques de esta situación es el problema de la búsqueda eficiente de información en un grupo de valores, puesto que dicha actividad es fundamental en muchos programas y una buena cantidad del tiempo de ejecución se va en localizar algo que el usuario quiere consultar. Dado este contexto, resulta muy conveniente ordenar la información que maneja el programa (objetos o valores simples) para que sea fácil de encontrar. El tema de búsqueda en particular será el que abordaremos en este módulo. Tenga en cuenta que el tiempo estimado para la realización de todas las actividades de este módulo es de cerca de 11 horas, tiempo que usted puede invertir de acuerdo con sus posibilidades. Le recomendamos que desarrolle todas las actividades en el orden propuesto y que considere hacerlo en un tiempo de dos semanas. ¡Le damos la bienvenida al módulo 4! Es un hecho que los programas de computador que se construyen deben evolucionar a medida que el problema y el contexto en el que éste ocurre cambian. Un programa de buena calidad es aquel que además de resolver el problema actual que se plantea, tiene una estructura que le permite evolucionar a costo razonable. No nos interesa construir un programa que tengamos que rehacer cada vez que algún aspecto del problema cambie o un nuevo requerimiento aparezca. Además de hacer evolucionar los programas a bajo costo, nos enfrentamos siempre al reto de hacer las implementaciones de la manera lo más eficiente posible (en tiempo e inversión). Para esto, lo ideal sería aprovechar otros desarrollos previos que nos ayuden en la construcción de nuestro programa. Esta es la idea del mecanismo de reutilización de clases denominado herencia, tema de este módulo. Imagínese los elevados costos si cada vez que nos lanzamos a construir un nuevo programa debemos partir desde cero. En este módulo vamos a enfrentarnos al problema de hacer implementaciones eficientes de programas: vamos a utilizar el mecanismo de herencia que nos permitirá reutilizar código de clases que ya implementamos para acelerar el tiempo que toma programar nuevas clases. A través del módulo nos familiarizaremos con los conceptos de superclases y subclases, entenderemos cómo a través de la visibilidad de los atributos y métodos podremos tener mayor o menor versatilidad al momento de implementar nuevas clases usando herencia. También explicaremos qué es una clase abstracta y sus implicaciones en el mundo del problema. Tenga en cuenta que el tiempo estimado para la realización de todas las actividades de este módulo es de cerca de 15 horas, tiempo que usted puede invertir de acuerdo con sus posibilidades. Le recomendamos que desarrolle todas las actividades en el orden propuesto y que considere hacerlo en un tiempo de dos semanas. ¡Le damos la bienvenida al módulo 5! A diferencia de los módulos anteriores, en este módulo del curso, vamos a cambiar de metodología de trabajo, ya que para construir una interfaz gráfica no se necesitan grandes habilidades algorítmicas. Se trata sobre todo de entender cómo utilizar algunas clases de Java que nos permiten crear los elementos gráficos y de interacción, cómo conectarlos entre sí y cómo conectarlos con el mundo del programa. Vamos a trabajar de la siguiente manera: primero revisaremos los conceptos teóricos básicos necesarios para ir creando poco a poco los elementos que componen la interfaz gráfica, estos son: la ventana principal, los páneles, las etiquetas, las cajas de textos y los botones. Segundo, veremos cómo repartir las responsabilidades entre la interfaz gráfica y el mundo y cómo conectarlos entre sí. Y por último, veremos cómo se maneja la interacción con el usuario. Después de cada presentación teórica, usted desarrollará un ejercicio para poner en práctica los nuevos conocimientos y enfrentarse al reto de hacerlo usted mismo con la ayuda de una guía de trabajo. El punto de partida de los retos de este módulo es el mundo de la aplicación. Su misión es construir la interfaz gráfica de forma incremental, ¡reto tras reto! Tenga en cuenta que el tiempo estimado para la realización de todas las actividades de este módulo es de cerca de 9 horas, tiempo que usted puede invertir de acuerdo con sus posibilidades.

Students are introduced to abstract classes, and will learn how to read and write to files, use regular expressions for parsing text, and how to leverage complex data structures like collections and maps.   Additionally, this course offers strategies for catching errors and debugging code, including an overview of Eclipse’s debugging tool. Subtitles: English Subtitles: English The University of Pennsylvania (commonly referred to as Penn) is a private university, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. A member of the Ivy League, Penn is the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, and considers itself to be the first university in the United States with both undergraduate and graduate studies.  We’ll start this module by talking about inheritance, a core concept in object-oriented programming.  It’s the mechanism by which one class inherits the fields and methods of another class.  Then we’ll learn about another aspect of polymorphism, overriding, which is creating a method in a subclass having the same signature as a method in a superclass.  In particular, we’ll look at overriding the toString method for printing your objects and the equals method for comparing your objects, especially as it relates to unit testing.  Finally, how you can restrict scope in a program by using modifiers to control access to variables, methods, and classes. Did you know you can declare a method without defining it? It’s like giving a method a name, and even parameters and a return type, with no code in the body. These are called abstract methods. To define abstract methods, we’ll learn how to create abstract classes. With these new concepts and structures, we’ll continue to expand our Java knowledge and develop our programming skills. We’ll also learn how to better debug our programs by running them interactively using Eclipse’s Debugger. This will allow us to watch the source code and the variables, during execution. There are multiple ways of loading and storing data in Java. Information can be stored and manipulated in different kinds of data structures. But data can also be stored in external files and then loaded into Java. In this module, we'll see how Java can communicate with the outside world by opening, reading from, and writing to, external files. This means of communication known as I/O or input/output, is extremely powerful with an overwhelming number of options. Any given I/O is not particularly difficult, but the difficulty lies in finding your way through the maze of possibilities. This module will help guide you through some of the different ways you can interact with external files. In addition, it will demonstrate methods you can use to handle errors and exceptions that may arise in your Java programs. In particular, when you're dealing with files. In this module, we're going to look at some advanced techniques for storing and manipulating data in collections, which are structured groups of objects. Specifically, we'll learn how to leverage Java's collections framework, which is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating different kinds of collections. We already have experience working with one type of collection in particular, and that's the ArrayList. We'll also learn how to leverage maps, which are dictionaries that associate keys with values. This module will also provide an overview of some advanced techniques for parsing text. In particular, we'll learn how to use regular expressions or regex, which are special sequences of characters that describe patterns used for searching, editing, and manipulating text and data. This Specialization starts out by teaching basic concepts in Python and ramps up to more complex subjects such as object-oriented programming and data structures in Java. By the time learners complete this series of four courses, they will be able to write fully-functional programs in both Python and Java, two of the most well-known and frequently used programming languages in the world today. Introduction to Programming with Python and Java is for students and professionals who have minimal or no prior programming exposure. It’s for motivated learners who have experience with rigorous coursework, and are looking to gain a competitive edge in advancing their career. It’s for folks who are thinking about applying to the University of Pennsylvania’s online Master of Computer and Information Technology degree and want to sample some of the lecture videos and content from the first course in the program. We hope this Specialization is for you.  Topics in this Specialization include language syntax, style, programming techniques, and coding conventions. Learn about best practices and good code design, code testing and test-driven development, code debugging, code and program documentation, and computational thinking. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:21h:1|2;Java

For more information about IBM visit: www.ibm.com Learn what Cloud Application development involves from the very beginning. Discover the languages, frameworks, and tools, that enable you to create interactive and engaging websites and Cloud Applications, right from the very beginning. In this module, you will learn about the roles of front-end, back-end, and full-stack developers and how they work together on development projects and become familiar with the terminology and skills you will need in your career as a Cloud App developer. It is recommended that learners practice outside of the course to become proficient. The labs are intended as an introduction to the basics.  The most fundamental tools for front-end developers are the languages they use for developing the website or app. Foremost among these is HyperText Markup Language (HTML). A good understanding of HTML, its features, support, and scripting capabilities, makes a solid foundation on which to build your development skills. Once you have mastered creating the basic structure of a website with HTML, you can add style with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which enables you to make your websites more attractive by adding a consistent style and design throughout. HTML5 has many elements that enable developers to create well-structured and varied websites. These HTML5 elements provide ways to separate an HTML document into divisions, create headers and footers, define sections, create headings, and delineate the body of the document. In addition, there are many HTML5 elements that allow the user to interact with the website, inputting information in various formats like dates, times, numbers, email addresses, and much more besides.  To be able to create the structure you want for your site, you must be familiar with some of these elements. So now you have a website or Cloud App with structure and content from HTML, consistent style from CSS, and a limited amount of interactivity for the user.  To enhance the user experience and create a real wow factor, you’re going to need JavaScript. With JavaScript, you can make your webpages dynamic, using features like interactive forms,  picture slideshows, and sophisticated menu systems. Web and Cloud App developers rarely work alone. Large projects will include many people – front-end developers, back-end developers, database administrators, and repository administrators. Every change by every contributor must be tracked and controlled to enable the changes to be merged seamlessly, to allow for potential rollbacks, and for accountability. This type of distributed version control is extremely important when managing large software projects. Git, GitHub, and Git Lab are some of the most widely used tools for collaboration, storage, and version control. Now that you have been equipped with the skills to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you will have the opportunity to practice and create a web application.  In this scenario, you are a web developer for an NGO. Everyone Can Get Rich is a non-governmental charity organization. This NGO works to improve the financial literacy of the common people. They have hired a developer to create an online application. This app titled Simple Interest Calculator, will compute the interest one can earn given the amount you wish to save, the number of years you can keep it with the bank and the interest rate the bank would pay you.   The NGO is very particular about the way the app looks including the colors and the alignment of the form elements. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:18h:1|2;Web Development

Innovation is central to who we are and what we do. Here, students learn that knowledge isn't just acquired in the classroom—life is their laboratory. Welcome to the first week of our course.  In this week, we'll get started by introducing ourselves and the Google engineers who will be making appearances throughout the course.  We'll also give you of the unique video series we provide and help you understand how to navigate the course to get the most out of it given your background and learning speed.  Finally, we'll jump right into objects and designing classes.  This might be a bit of review for some of you who might have learned this in your first programming course.  If that's the case, feel free to jump ahead to the Practice Quiz at the end of the week. Let's get started! We hope you’re excited about the project that we're starting to build -- we sure are!  In this second part of this week, we'll walk you through setting up your system and working through your first assignment so you'll be having fun with it in no time. Before that though, we'll finish going over some of the fundamentals fundamentals of object oriented programming.  Specifically, being able to trace code is a key skill in becoming a stronger programmer. Like the end of last week, the first part of this week might be a bit of a review of material you already learned in your first Java programming course.  If that’s the case, you are always welcome to skip to the first graded assignment on Objects, Memory Models, and Scope. Now that you have the tools to write and trace object oriented code, let’s get back to developing the project! In this first (real) part of the project, you will create an interactive graphical map that will display geospatial data. This is a highly interactive week, so make sure you’ve got Eclipse loaded up!  We encourage you to play around as you watch the videos.  Some of the code that we use in the videos is in the demos package in the starter code you set up for this course.  Open it up and experiment with it while you're watching the videos.  We also encourage you to dive right into the programming project, even before watching the videos, if you want.  The programming assignment instructions are in the last lesson of this week - you can watch a video walkthrough of the instructions and also read the step-by-step directions in the accompanying reading. There’s lots of room for creativity, too, so have fun! Now that you’re in full swing with the project, let’s take a closer look at some concepts that you have already been using in your code.  Specifically, the keyword “extends”.  What exactly does it mean that your program “extends PApplet”? To answer this question we’ll need to dive into the details of how Java allows for Class Hierarchies through Inheritance and Polymorphism.  These fundamental and powerful concepts will serve you well in the future!  We’ll use these ideas to allow for displaying markers differently.  If you feel you’re already comfortable with Inheritance and Polymorphism, feel free to dive straight into the project (programming assignment) for this week.  As you work with the project, feel free to have some fun and introduce new levels of class hierarchies for improved functionality.     You’ve reached an exciting point in the project - in this week you’ll add interactivity to your map!  You’ll be learning how to design event-driven programs, using a new and powerful programming paradigm.  Your map will now respond to mouse hovers and clicks. As always, make sure you're writing code along with us as you watch the videos and work through the week.  Also, feel free to dive into the programming assignment (project) whenever you are ready You've come a long way in this course, and you've got a great project to show for it. In this last module we'll shift gears a bit to talk about some very exciting and fundamental algorithms for finding and sorting data in an array.  Searching and sorting algorithms are not only fundamental to computer science, but also ideal for beginning to explore issues of algorithm efficiency. We will only begin to touch on issues of algorithm efficiency here.  We will say much more about it in the next course in this specialization, so we hope you will continue with us.   We'll also apply sorting to your project, and you'll wrap things up by finishing your project with an extension of your own choosing. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:7h:1|2;Algorithms

Parallel programming enables developers to use multicore computers to make their applications run faster by using multiple processors at the same time. By the end of this course, you will learn how to use popular parallel Java frameworks (such as ForkJoin, Stream, and Phaser) to write parallel programs for a wide range of multicore platforms including servers, desktops, or mobile devices, while also learning about their theoretical foundations including computation graphs, ideal parallelism, parallel speedup, Amdahl's Law, data races, and determinism. Why take this course?  • All computers are multicore computers, so it is important for you to learn how to extend your knowledge of sequential Java programming to multicore parallelism. • Java 7 and Java 8 have introduced new frameworks for parallelism (ForkJoin, Stream) that have significantly changed the paradigms for parallel programming since the early days of Java. • Each of the four modules in the course includes an assigned mini-project that will provide you with the necessary hands-on experience to use the concepts learned in the course on your own, after the course ends. • During the course, you will have online access to the instructor and the mentors to get individualized answers to your questions posted on forums.  The desired learning outcomes of this course are as follows:  • Theory of parallelism: computation graphs, work, span, ideal parallelism, parallel speedup, Amdahl's Law, data races, and determinism • Task parallelism using Java’s ForkJoin framework • Functional parallelism using Java’s Future and Stream frameworks • Loop-level parallelism with extensions for barriers and iteration grouping (chunking) • Dataflow parallelism using the Phaser framework and data-driven tasks  Mastery of these concepts will enable you to immediately apply them in the context of multicore Java programs, and will also provide the foundation for mastering other parallel programming systems that you may encounter in the future  (e.g., C++11, OpenMP, .Net Task Parallel Library).

Rice has highly respected schools of Architecture, Business, Continuing Studies, Engineering, Humanities, Music, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences and is home to the Baker Institute for Public Policy. Welcome to Parallel Programming in Java! This course is designed as a three-part series and covers a theme or body of knowledge through various video lectures, demonstrations, and coding projects. In this module, we will learn the fundamentals of task parallelism. Tasks are the most basic unit of parallel programming. An increasing number of programming languages (including Java and C++) are moving from older thread-based approaches to more modern task-based approaches for parallel programming. We will learn about task creation, task termination, and the “computation graph” theoretical model for understanding various properties of task-parallel programs.  These properties include work, span, ideal parallelism, parallel speedup, and Amdahl’s Law. We will also learn popular Java APIs for task parallelism, most notably the Fork/Join framework. Welcome to Module 2!  In this module, we will learn about approaches to parallelism that have been inspired by functional programming.  Advocates of parallel functional programming have argued for decades that functional parallelism can eliminate many hard-to-detect bugs that can occur with imperative parallelism.  We will learn about futures, memoization, and streams, as well as data races, a notorious class of bugs that can be avoided with functional parallelism.  We will also learn Java APIs for functional parallelism, including the Fork/Join framework and the Stream API’s. Join Professor Vivek Sarkar as he talks with Two Sigma Managing Director, Jim Ward, and Software Engineers, Margaret Kelley and Jake Kornblau, at their downtown Houston, Texas office about the importance of parallel programming. Welcome to Module 3, and congratulations on reaching the midpoint of this course!  It is well known that many applications spend a majority of their execution time in loops, so there is a strong motivation to learn how loops can be sped up through the use of parallelism, which is the focus of this module.  We will start by learning how parallel counted-for loops can be conveniently expressed using forall and stream APIs in Java, and how these APIs can be used to parallelize a simple matrix multiplication program.  We will also learn about the barrier construct for parallel loops, and illustrate its use with a simple iterative averaging program example.  Finally, we will learn the importance of grouping/chunking parallel iterations to reduce overhead. Welcome to the last module of the course!  In this module, we will wrap up our introduction to parallel programming by learning how data flow principles can be used to increase the amount of parallelism in a program.  We will learn how Java’s Phaser API can be used to implement “fuzzy” barriers, and also “point-to-point” synchronizations as an optimization of regular barriers by revisiting the iterative averaging example.  Finally, we will also learn how pipeline parallelism and data flow models can be expressed using Java APIs.   The next two videos will showcase the importance of learning about Concurrent Programming and Distributed Programming in Java. Professor Vivek Sarkar will speak with industry professionals at Two Sigma about how the topics of our other two courses are utilized in the field. Parallel, concurrent, and distributed programming underlies software in multiple domains, ranging from biomedical research to financial services. This specialization is intended for anyone with a basic knowledge of sequential programming in Java, who is motivated to learn how to write parallel, concurrent and distributed programs. Through a collection of three courses (which may be taken in any order or separately), you will learn foundational topics in Parallelism, Concurrency, and Distribution. These courses will prepare you for multithreaded and distributed programming for a wide range of computer platforms, from mobile devices to cloud computing servers.

But adding some of these types of capabilities requires a stronger programming language than HTML5 or CSS3, and JavaScript can provide just what you need.  With just a basic understanding of the language, you can create a page that will react to common events such as page loads, mouse clicks & movements, and even keyboard input.       This course will introduce you to the basics of the JavaScript language.  We will cover concepts such as variables, looping, functions, and even a little bit about debugging tools.  You will understand how the Document Object Model (DOM) is used by JavaScript to identify and modify specific parts of your page.  After the course, learners will be able to react to DOM Events and dynamically alter the contents and style of their page.   The class will culminate in a  final project - the creation of an interactive HTML5 form that accepts and verifies input.  This is the third course in the Web Design For Everybody specialization.  A basic understanding of HTML and CSS is expected when you enroll in this class.    Additional courses focus on enhancing the styling with responsive design and completing a capstone project.

If you haven't use a traditional programming language before, this first week is key.  Before we begin with the how, we will talk about the why, mainly why we want to use JavaScript.  The main reason is that it is very easy for JavaScript to work with the DOM.  And easy is always a great way to start.  Speaking of starting out, it is also always more fun when our code actually does something we can see, so we will jump quickly into different ways we can generate output.  It won't be flashy yet, but it will be a great way to get your feet wet with traditional programming.  After that we go back to the basics of how a computer uses data.  We begin with variables, expressions, and operators.   If you have written HTML code in the past, hopefully you have fallen into the great habit of validating your code -- making sure that you close all of your open tags.  There are other rules that you may or may not have been following as well, for instance the importance of using each id attribute only once per page. This is called writing clean code.  The reasoning and importance of following these rules becomes clear as we begin to manipulate the different components of your webpage based on the the actions of the person interacting with your page.  In particular you will learn about the JavaScript Mouse Events and Touch Events.  This week's materials will end with a photo gallery example that you can create along with me. This week we will delve into more complex programming concepts: arrays and looping.  Arrays allow you to represent groups of related information.  Looping provides efficiency and flexibility to your programs.  Using both we will expand upon the photo gallery example. This week we will put a number of the concepts from this course together to tackle a new project - creating and validating input entered into an HTML5 form.  Forms are extremely common elements used to input and send data to via a webpage.  We will look at how you can use JavaScript to add options to your forms, to pre-fill data based on previous input, and even to check that passwords match. This Specialization covers how to write syntactically correct HTML5 and CSS3, and how to create interactive web experiences with JavaScript. Mastering this range of technologies will allow you to develop high quality web sites that, work seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and large screen browsers accessible. During the capstone you will develop a professional-quality web portfolio demonstrating your growth as a web developer and your knowledge of accessible web design. This will include your ability to design and implement a responsive site that utilizes tools to create a site that is accessible to a wide audience, including those with visual, audial, physical, and cognitive impairments. ;10;1;1;Długość kursu:50h:1|2;Web Development

This means less operational overhead for you and your business, and more focusing on the applications and business specific projects that differentiate you in your marketplace. In this course, we will be covering how to build a modern, greenfield serverless backend on AWS.  Building brand new applications on AWS is a different task than lifting and shifting existing applications into AWS. When you have an existing application that you need to move to AWS, you might first look to using Amazon EC2 as your virtual machines, or maybe you might look into using docker containers and container hosting services like Amazon Elastic Container Service or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service. Those are all great application hosting options, but in most cases, they still require you to have some kind of pulse on the underlying infrastructure hosting your application.  `  Building Modern Java Applications on AWS will explore how to build an API driven application using Amazon API Gateway for serverless API hosting, AWS Lambda for serverless computing, and Amazon Cognito for serverless authentication. We will follow an API driven development process and first mock up what the API will look like. We will cover all the ins and outs of the service Amazon API Gateway, and as you’ll learn- it does a lot more than just hosting an API.   Then we will add authentication to the API using Amazon Cognito. You’ll learn about how the authorization flow works with Cognito, and how to build it into your APIs. From there, we will add a Lambda backend that will be triggered by API Gateway. The lambda functions will be using the AWS SDKs to perform various data processing tasks. You’ll learn about the different configurations that exist for Lambda, and we will show you how to create and manage lambda functions. Some of the features of our API will require multiple lambda functions to execute in a specific order, like a workflow, and we will use AWS Step Functions to create a serverless workflow. Finally, we will talk about how to optimize your APIs at every layer using AWS features.  Note: There are four versions of this class, Building Modern Node.js Applications on AWS for Node.js developers, Building Modern Python Applications on AWS for Python developers, Building Modern .NET Applications on AWS for .NET developers, and this course, Building Modern Java Applications on AWS for Java developers. The courses do for a large part, overlap and in general, we recommend that you take the course that focuses on the SDK you plan to use to develop your AWS Cloud based applications.  We expect that you have basic knowledge of AWS already. Some examples of concepts you should be familiar with are: you should know the basics of the AWS Global infrastructure, like what regions and availability zones are. You also should know the at a high-level AWS Identity and Access Management, or IAM, and how it is used to control access to AWS resources. You should also understand what an Amazon EC2 instance is, what Amazon S3 is, what a VPC is, as well as other basic AWS terminology. Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Since 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. AWS offers over 90 fully featured services for compute, storage, networking, database, analytics, application services, deployment, management, developer, mobile, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence, security, hybrid and enterprise applications, from 44 Availability Zones across 16 geographic regions.  AWS services are trusted by millions of active customers around the world — including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies — to power their infrastructure, make them more agile, and lower costs.  Coursera and AWS have been partners since 2017 providing learners and enterprises globally, the skills they need to succeed.  Coursera builds on AWS servers to scale with student demand with confidence around capacity and elasticity and in partnership with AWS.  In 2019, Coursera achieved Advanced Tier Partner status and further extended the partnership with AWS Educate, AWS EdStart and AWS Academy collaborations.   Coursera's been able to make cloud skills more accessible with 8 AWS courses on the Coursera platform featuring top subject matter experts and the portfolio continues to grow.    To learn more about AWS, visit https://aws.amazon.com. This specialization is designed to help you master the skills of designing and building cloud-native applications on AWS. We begin with the foundational technical and cloud knowledge that you need to have to build in the AWS Cloud. In the first course, you will be introduced to several AWS compute services, different storage and database offerings that AWS provides, AWS’ networking capabilities, monitoring capabilities and the AWS IAM service. The second course of the specialization explores how to build an API driven application using Amazon API Gateway for serverless API hosting, AWS Lambda for serverless computing and Amazon Cognito for serverless authentication.  Modern applications require a modern database. Hence, the third course introduces you to NoSQL databases and the challenges they solve. We will dive deep into Amazon DynamoDB topics such as recovery, SDKs, partition keys, security and encryption, global tables, stateless applications, streams, and best practices. DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.  Finally, you’ll learn how to use Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer to detect issues and identify recommendations to improve the quality and security of your code.

Welcome to “Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data”! We are excited that you are starting our course to learn how to write programs in Java, one of the most popular programming languages in the world. In this introductory module, you will hear an overview of this course and be introduced to the supporting resources available. In this module, you will learn about the basics of cryptography, the science of keeping information private and secure. You will learn about simpler cryptographic systems, which were used from the Roman Empire through the early 1900s. You will learn how to implement these ciphers, as well as how to break them. To solve these problems, you will work more with processing Strings, but also learn about arrays—a way to store an indexable sequence of elements. You will be able to: (1) combine Strings using concatenation (2) build Strings within a Java program using StringBuilder (3) use arrays to store and manipulate collections of data (4) refactor your programs for improved organization using object-oriented principles (5) and practice effective algorithm design. After completing this module, you will be able (1) to program a word frequency counter to analyze any input text file, (2) to select and substitute words from a list into a document template using both ArrayList and HashMap, (3) to create new lists to use in templates, (4) to recognize brittle code, and (5) to improve code with flexible, object-oriented design. You will gain these skills in the framework of developing a randomly generated story that we call GladLibs. You may discover that bald lions change peoples’ lives, or that fluffy dinosaurs get things done in a jiffy. We hope you have fun developing your Java skills this week! In this module, you will learn about how web server logs store information about visitors to a website, and you will write programs to access information like user IP address, date and time of access, and more. Using Java programs you write in this module, you will be able (1) to read information from a web server log, (2) to count the number of unique visitors to your website, and (3) to count the number of times each visitor uses your website. In this module, you will develop a program to break the Vigenère Cipher, a more complex version of the Caesar Cipher. You will improve your program in three stages: first decrypting messages where you know the language and key length, then adding the capability to handle messages with unknown key length, then extending the program to handle messages in a range of possible languages. Through this project, you will be able (1) to effectively use HashSet and HashMap, (2) to expand an algorithm from solving a simpler problem to handle broader, more complex problems, and (3) to design and modify program code involving a more complex collection of classes, methods, and data.  ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:47h:1|2;Algorithms

Concurrent programming enables developers to efficiently and correctly mediate the use of shared resources in parallel programs.  By the end of this course, you will learn how to use basic concurrency constructs in Java such as threads, locks, critical sections, atomic variables, isolation, actors, optimistic concurrency and concurrent collections, as well as their theoretical foundations (e.g., progress guarantees, deadlock, livelock, starvation, linearizability). Why take this course?  • It is important for you to be aware of the theoretical foundations of concurrency to avoid common but subtle programming errors.  • Java 8 has modernized many of the concurrency constructs since the early days of threads and locks. • During the course, you will have online access to the instructor and mentors to get individualized answers to your questions posted on the forums. • Each of the four modules in the course includes an assigned mini-project that will provide you with the necessary hands-on experience to use the concepts learned in the course on your own, after the course ends.  The desired learning outcomes of this course are as follows:  • Concurrency theory: progress guarantees, deadlock, livelock, starvation, linearizability • Use of threads and structured/unstructured locks in Java • Atomic variables and isolation • Optimistic concurrency and concurrent collections in Java (e.g., concurrent queues, concurrent  hashmaps) • Actor model in Java  Mastery of these concepts will enable you to immediately apply them in the context of concurrent Java programs, and will also help you master other concurrent programming system that you may encounter in the future  (e.g., POSIX threads, .NET threads).

Rice has highly respected schools of Architecture, Business, Continuing Studies, Engineering, Humanities, Music, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences and is home to the Baker Institute for Public Policy. Welcome to Concurrent Programming in Java! This course is designed as a three-part series and covers a theme or body of knowledge through various video lectures, demonstrations, and coding projects. In this module, we will learn about threads and locks, which have served as primitive building blocks for concurrent programming for over five decades.  All computing platforms today include some form of support for threads and locks, and make them available for use by developers in a wide range of programming languages. We will learn how threads can be created, joined, and synchronized using structured (e.g., synchronized statements/methods) and unstructured (e.g., java.util.concurrent libraries) locks in Java.  We will also learn about new classes of bugs that can arise when concurrent programs need to access shared resources.  These bugs are referred to as violations of liveness/progress guarantees, and include deadlock, livelock, and starvation.  We will conclude this module by studying different solutions to the classical Dining Philosophers problem, and use these solutions to illustrate instances of deadlock, livelock and starvation. In this module, we will learn different approaches to coordinating accesses to shared resources without encountering the deadlock or livelock bugs studied earlier.  Critical/isolated sections are higher-level concurrent programming constructs (relative to locks) that simplify the implementation of mutual exclusion by guaranteeing the absence of deadlocks and livelocks.  Object-based isolation relaxes the constraints imposed by critical sections by allowing mutual exclusion to be specified on a per-object basis, as illustrated in the Spanning Tree example.  Java's atomic variables represent an important, but restricted, case of object-based isolation that is implemented efficiently on all hardware platforms.  Finally, we will learn how object-based isolation can be further relaxed with read/write access modes. Join Professor Vivek Sarkar as he talks with Software Engineer, Dr. Shams Imam, at their downtown Houston, Texas office about threads, locks, deadlocks, high-level and low-level constructs, and the importance of concurrent programming. In this module, we will learn another high-level approach to concurrent programming called the Actor model.  A major difference between the Actor model and the Isolated Sections model is that there are no data races possible in the Actor model because it does not allow for any form of shared variables.  However, as in all concurrent programming models, higher-level forms of nondeterminism are still possible in the Actor model due to an inherent asynchrony in the order in which messages may be delivered.  We will study multiple examples of concurrency using the Actor model, including the classical Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers, as well as producer-consumer patterns with both unbounded and bounded buffers. In this module, we will study Concurrent Data Structures, which form an essential software layer in all multithreaded programming systems.  First, we will learn about Optimistic Concurrency, an important multithreaded pattern in which two threads can optimistically make progress on their assigned work without worrying about mutual conflicts, and only checking for conflicts before committing the results of their work.  We will then study the widely-used Concurrent Queue data structure.  Even though the APIs for using concurrent queues are very simple, their implementations using the Optimistic Concurrency model can be complex and error-prone.   To that end, we will also learn the formal notion of Linearizability to better understand correctness requirements for concurrent data structures.  We will then study Concurrent Hash Maps, another widely-used concurrent data structure.  Finally, we discuss a concurrent algorithm for finding a Minimum Spanning Tree of an undirected graph, an algorithm that relies on the use of Concurrent Data Structures under the covers. The next two videos will showcase the importance of learning about Parallel Programming and Distributed Programming in Java. Professor Vivek Sarkar will speak with industry professionals at Two Sigma about how the topics of our other two courses are utilized in the field. Parallel, concurrent, and distributed programming underlies software in multiple domains, ranging from biomedical research to financial services. This specialization is intended for anyone with a basic knowledge of sequential programming in Java, who is motivated to learn how to write parallel, concurrent and distributed programs. Through a collection of three courses (which may be taken in any order or separately), you will learn foundational topics in Parallelism, Concurrency, and Distribution. These courses will prepare you for multithreaded and distributed programming for a wide range of computer platforms, from mobile devices to cloud computing servers.

The university has a strong commitment to applying knowledge in service to society, both near its North Carolina campus and around the world. Welcome to “Java Programming: Principles of Software Design”! We are excited that you are starting our course to learn how to write programs in Java, one of the most popular programming languages in the world. In this introductory module, you will hear an overview of this course and be introduced to the supporting resources available. In this module, we will introduce a data set containing details about earthquakes around the world. You will learn how to pull this data into a program, search through the data, and filter the data based on desired criteria. By the end of this module, you will be able to (1) write programs that include multiple classes and ArrayLists of class types, (2) find the maximum value in an ArrayList, (3) use a Filter interface to search through data, (4) implement interfaces with method signatures, and (5) combine several filters together. In this module, you will continue using real earthquake data to explore several sorting algorithms. You will learn how to implement a selection sort and a bubble sort, then be introduced to a Java method Collections.sort, which sorts with much greater efficiency. By the end of this module, you will be able to (1) implement several sorting algorithms from scratch, (2) use efficient pre-existing sorting classes, (3) modify a class’s compareTo method to choose the criteria by which objects of that type are ordered, and (4) write classes that implement the Comparator interface to create interchangeable sorting criteria. In this module, you will explore some of the underlying concepts of predictive text. The first lesson will introduce random character generation and then how to train the character selection based on an input text. The second lesson will extend this concept to complete words. By the end of this module, you will be able to: (1) base random text generation on the frequency of characters in a training text, (2) collect a set of characters that occur in a text after randomly chosen initial character(s) to create a semi-random text, (3) extend the predictive text generation to use whole words, and (4) implement your own .equals method to compare complex data types. As you reach the end of this series, you may wish to extend your Java experience to tools beyond those provided here. This module will cover some of the Java basic information that is needed to program without BlueJ or the edu.duke library. After completing this module, you will be able to: (1) write a main method to start a Java program in any programming environment, (2) use the “static” keyword to modify fields, (3) find alternative editors to use with Java, (4) use exceptions to debug your program and make it more robust, and (5) reference Java libraries that are necessary to read files without the edu.duke library. Take your first step towards a career in software development with this introduction to Java—one of the most in-demand programming languages and the foundation of the Android operating system. Designed for beginners, this Specialization will teach you core programming concepts and equip you to write programs to solve complex problems. In addition, you will gain the foundational skills a software engineer needs to solve real-world problems, from designing algorithms to testing and debugging your programs. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:16h:1|2;Algorithms

How does an internet router forward packets of network traffic to minimize delay?  How does an aid group allocate resources to its affiliated local partners? To solve such problems, we first represent the key pieces of data in a complex data structure. In this course, you’ll learn about data structures, like graphs, that are fundamental for working with structured real world data.  You will develop, implement, and analyze algorithms for working with this data to solve real world problems.   In addition, as the programs you develop in this course become more complex, we’ll examine what makes for good code and class hierarchy design so that you can not only write correct code, but also share it with other people and maintain it in the future.  The backbone project in this course will be a route planning application.  You will apply the concepts from each Module directly to building an application that allows an autonomous agent (or a human driver!) to navigate its environment.

Innovation is central to who we are and what we do. Here, students learn that knowledge isn't just acquired in the classroom—life is their laboratory. Welcome to the first week in the third course of our Intermediate Java Programming Specialization.  Once again start with introductions, and in particular introduce the unique structure of this course.  Also, if you're not sure if this course is right for you, we've got an optional pre-course quiz coming right up that can help you figure out if you're in the right place.  If you decide to stay with us (and we really hope you will!) we've got a great backbone project for you: your very own mapping application, inspired by Google Maps!  The core data structure throughout this course is graphs, which may very well be the most fundamental data structure in all of computer science.  Ready to begin?  So are we! This week we'll start getting technical, introducing you to the central data structure in the course: Graphs.  You'll learn the basics and then have a chance to dive in a little deeper into the code, getting ready to start building that Google Maps-like application. This week you'll get the backbone of your map search engine up and running.  In previous courses, including the previous courses in this specialization, you've probably been given most of the classes you needed to complete the assignments.  But learning how to design classes from scratch is a key skill that you will need as you become a more sophisticated Java programmer.  This week we'll give you the tools you need to create a robust and elegant class design for your map search engine.  We'll introduce a similar problem and show you how it can be represented as a graph.  Then we'll introduce two core search algorithms: depth-first search and breadth-first search.  Finally, we'll turn our graph problem into a set of Java classes.   Your task on the programming assignment this week will be to do the same thing, but in the context on the map search engine! In the past two weeks, you've developed a strong understanding of how to design classes to represent a graph and how to use a graph to represent a map.  In this week, you'll add a key feature of map data to our graph representation -- distances -- by adding weights to your edges to produce a weighted graph.  Although this might seem like a small change, the algorithms that work for unweighted graphs may prove ineffective for weighted graphs.  To address this problem, you'll explore more advanced shortest path algorithms.  First, you'll see how to find the shortest path on a weighted graph, then you'll see how to find it more quickly.  In the project, you'll apply these ideas to create the core of any good mapping application: finding the shortest route from one location to another. In this week, we'll go beyond the problem of finding a path between two points, and focus on problems requiring overall path planning.  For example, if you wanted to go on errands and visit 6 different locations before returning home, what is the optimal route? This problem is actually a really well known problem in computer science known as the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP).  Attempting to solve the problem will lead us to explore complexity theory, what it means to be NP-Hard, and how to solve hard problems using heuristics and approximation algorithms.  We'll end the week by showing how reformulating a problem can have a huge impact: making something which was effectively unsolvable before, now solvable!   You made it to the last week of our course!  We're glad you're still with us.  As a reward, there's no new content to learn this week.  Instead you'll get the opportunity to extend your project in a direction of your own choosing.  We hope you've got some neat ideas for personalizing your map application, and we look forward to seeing them in the peer review gallery.  Submitting to the peer review gallery is optional (though the extension is required), but we hope you'll choose to participate.   This Specialization covers intermediate topics in software development. You’ll learn object-oriented programming principles that will allow you to use Java to its full potential, and you’ll implement data structures and algorithms for organizing large amounts of data in a way that is both efficient and easy to work with. You’ll also practice critically evaluating your own code, and you’ll build technical communication skills that will help you prepare for job interviews and collaborative work as a software engineer. In the final Capstone Project, you’ll apply your skills to analyze data collected from a real-world (social) network. Google has contributed real-world projects and the involvement of its engineers as guest lecturers to these courses. A small, select group of top learners who complete the Specialization will be offered practice interviews with Google recruiters. Invitation to a practice interview does not guarantee an actual interview or employment. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:43h:1|2;Algorithms

As we begin to add interactive elements to our web pages, we need to learn JavaScript.  For students with a JavaScript background this will be a bit of review as we learn JavaScript from a Django perspective. The Object-Oriented approach in JavaScript is different from Object Orientation in Python in some important ways.  So we look at the unique features of the OO pattern in JavaScript.  The high level concepts are the same between Python and JavaScript but the implementation details are different in important and subtle ways. There are many JavaScript libraries to make it easier to do common tasks in the browser.  jQuery is one of the more popular libraries that are available and we use it in this course because it is so common.   But concepts in this section apply to vanilla JavaScript or other JavaScript frameworks. JSON and AJAX allow web pages to add interactivity and interact with the back-end without sending entire web pages back and forth to the server. In this module we extend our application to add search to our classified ads application. This specialization introduces Python programmers to building websites using the Django library. Across the four courses, you will learn HTML, CSS, SQL, Django, JavaScript, jQuery, and JSON Web Services. During the course, you will build online websites using Django and those working websites are graded throughout the course. This series is excellent preparation for learning other ways to build web applications using technologies like PHP (Web Applications for Everybody), Flask or Ruby on Rails. This is a great first course in any web development curriculum. Learners are encouraged to take the Python for Everybody Specialization or equivalent before beginning this specialization.

In this video, we will introduce you to this course and explain what you will learn. This module foreshadows the entire course, covering O-O Relationships, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Interfaces, Aggregation, and Design Guidelines.  The following modules revisit selected topics in more detail. This module goes into more detail on implementing class inheritance in Java, including overriding methods, invoking overridden parent methods using super, and more. This module discusses Abstract classes, including what they are where you might use them how to implement them and concludes with discussion of casting, which is the technique of taking a reference of a given type, and asserting a different type. Interfaces are the key to polymorphism in Java, since Java requires inheritance in order to implement polymorphism, and classes are limited to the single inheritance graph.  This module goes into more detail on interfaces and polymorphism, and includes discussion of new Java 8 features, such as default and static methods, Functional Interfaces, Java Lambdas, and Method References. Just as the first module served to foreshadow the entire content of this course, this module serves as a brief capstone, with a conceptual discussion of polymorphism mechanisms in Java, and practices for ensuring that polymorphism is an option in your programs. This Core Java Specialization is part of a series of programming specializations, derived from LearnQuest's private Java Bootcamps, designed to provide the skill set necessary to be hired as an IT developer using Java in many corporate environments. To be successful in this specialization, we recommend you have an understanding of the fundamentals of software development in any language. LearnQuest offers a beginning programmer specialization that can help you prepare.  In the four courses of this specialization, you’ll quickly master the Java programming language and the packages that constitute its rich set of core libraries. We’ll provide hands-on exercises so you can practice your new skills.  In Course 1, we’ll introduce you to the basic fundamentals of the Java language.  Course 2 provides a refresher on object-oriented programming, and how you can apply OO to Java. We’ll introduce Java classes, instances and packaging.  By the time you get to course 3, you’ll be ready to go deeper into applying OOP concepts in Java, including inheritance and polymorphism.  In course 4 you’ll learn how to use selected parts of the Java SE Class LIbrary, including Generics, Collections, Java Streams, I/O, Exceptions, Annotations and Enums.

Добро пожаловать на первую неделю курса! Вы узнаете, о предпосылках появления JavaScript и его истории. Познакомитесь с основными типами данных. Настроите окружение и напишите ваши первые программы. На этой неделе вы продолжите изучать типы данных. Поговорим о более сложных — строки, массивы, объекты, функции. В лекциях мы постарались продемонстрировать теорию на примерах. И подготовили 3 задачи, которые помогут закрепить изученный материал. На третьей неделе курса рассмотрим нюансы работы с объектами. Познакомимся с обработкой исключений: реакцией программы на возможные проблемы, которые приводят к невозможности или бессмысленности дальнейшей работы вашей программы. В конце недели — очередная задача, в рамках которой вы научитесь организовывать цепочки вызовов функций в JavaScript. JavaScript — выразительный язык, который имеет свои особенности. Работа с функциями, такие понятия как всплытие и замыкание переменных зачастую приводят в замешательство новичков. На этой неделе разберёмся с этими тонкостями языка. А в качестве практической задачи вас ждёт работа с коллекцией однотипных объектов. С понятием контекста исполнения в JavaScript связано ключевое слово this. Это мощный инструмент, но разобраться в нём непросто. Заключительная неделя курса будет интересна не только новичкам, но и программистам, которые хотят освежить этот аспект в памяти. В качестве практического задания — создание библиотеки, позволяющей подписываться на события и получать по ним уведомления. Пройдя эту специализацию, вы освоите основные инструменты разработчика интерфейсов. Если всё получится, через 5 месяцев вы сможете работать младшим фронтендером. Специализация состоит из двух частей: два курса про вёрстку и ещё два по JavaScript. Курсы про вёрстку не требуют практически никакой подготовки. Научиться основам JavaScript труднее, поэтому кое-какая подготовка нужна: преподаватели ожидают, что вы уже умеете программировать на каком-нибудь объектно-ориентированном или функциональном языке (например, C++, CSharp, Java, Python или Haskell).  Главная изюминка всех четырёх курсов — сложные, но не оторванные от реальности практические задания.

Distributed programming enables developers to use multiple nodes in a data center to increase throughput and/or reduce latency of selected applications.  By the end of this course, you will learn how to use popular distributed programming frameworks for Java programs, including Hadoop, Spark, Sockets, Remote Method Invocation (RMI), Multicast Sockets, Kafka, Message Passing Interface (MPI), as well as different approaches to combine distribution with multithreading. Why take this course?  • All data center servers are organized as collections of distributed servers, and it is important for you to also learn how to use multiple servers for increased bandwidth and reduced latency. • In addition to learning specific frameworks for distributed programming, this course will teach you how to integrate multicore and distributed parallelism in a unified approach. • Each of the four modules in the course includes an assigned mini-project that will provide you with the necessary hands-on experience to use the concepts learned in the course on your own, after the course ends. • During the course, you will have online access to the instructor and the mentors to get individualized answers to your questions posted on forums.  The desired learning outcomes of this course are as follows:  • Distributed map-reduce programming in Java using the Hadoop and Spark frameworks • Client-server programming using Java's Socket and Remote Method Invocation (RMI) interfaces • Message-passing programming in Java using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) • Approaches to combine distribution with multithreading, including processes and threads, distributed actors, and reactive programming  Mastery of these concepts will enable you to immediately apply them in the context of distributed Java programs, and will also provide the foundation for mastering other distributed programming frameworks that you may encounter in the future  (e.g., in Scala or C++).

Rice has highly respected schools of Architecture, Business, Continuing Studies, Engineering, Humanities, Music, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences and is home to the Baker Institute for Public Policy. Welcome to Distributed Programming in Java! This course is designed as a three-part series and covers a theme or body of knowledge through various video lectures, demonstrations, and coding projects. In this module, we will learn about the MapReduce paradigm, and how it can be used to write distributed programs that analyze data represented as key-value pairs.  A MapReduce program is defined via user-specified map and reduce functions, and we will learn how to write such programs in the Apache Hadoop and Spark projects.  TheMapReduce paradigm can be used to express a wide range of parallel algorithms.  One example that we will study is computation of the TermFrequency – Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) statistic used in document mining this algorithm uses a fixed (non-iterative) number of map and reduce operations.  Another MapReduce example that we will study is parallelization of the PageRank algorithm.  This algorithm is an example of iterative MapReduce computations, and is also the focus of the mini-project associated with this module. In this module, we will learn about client-server programming, and how distributed Java applications can communicate with each other using sockets.  Since communication via sockets occurs at the level of bytes, we will learn how to serialize objects into bytes in the sender process and to deserialize bytes into objects in the receiver process. Sockets and serialization provide the necessary background for theFile Server mini-project associated with this module.  We will also learn about Remote Method Invocation (RMI), which extends the notion of method invocation in a sequential program to a distributed programming setting.  Likewise, we will learn about multicast sockets,which generalize the standard socket interface to enable a sender to send the same message to a specified set of receivers this capability can be very useful for a number of applications, including news feeds,video conferencing, and multi-player games.  Finally, we will learn about distributed publish-subscribe applications, and how they can be implemented using the Apache Kafka framework. Join Professor Vivek Sarkar as he talks with Two Sigma Managing Director, Jim Ward, and Senior Vice President, Dr. Eric Allen at their downtown Houston, Texas office about the importance of distributed programming. In this module, we will learn how to write distributed applications in the Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) model, specifically by using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) library.  MPI processes can send and receive messages using primitives for point-to-point communication, which are different in structure and semantics from message-passing with sockets.  We will also learn about the message ordering and deadlock properties of MPI programs.  Non-blocking communications are an interesting extension of point-to-point communications, since they can be used to avoid delays due to blocking and to also avoid deadlock-related errors.  Finally, we will study collective communication, which can involve multiple processes in a manner that is more powerful than multicast and publish-subscribe operations.  The knowledge of MPI gained in this module will be put to practice in the mini-project associated with this module on implementing a distributed matrix multiplication program in MPI. In this module, we will study the roles of processes and threads as basic building blocks of parallel, concurrent, and distributed Java programs.  With this background, we will then learn how to implement multithreaded servers for increased responsiveness in distributed applications written using sockets, and apply this knowledge in the mini-project on implementing a parallel file server using both multithreading and sockets.  An analogous approach can also be used to combine MPI and multithreading, so as to improve the performance of distributed MPI applications.  Distributed actors serve as yet another example of combining distribution and multithreading.  A notable property of the actor model is that the same high-level constructs can be used to communicate among actors running in the same process and among actors in different processes the difference between the two cases depends on the application configuration, rather the application code.  Finally, we will learn about the reactive programming model,and its suitability for implementing distributed service oriented architectures using asynchronous events. The next two videos will showcase the importance of learning about Parallel Programming and Concurrent Programming in Java. Professor Vivek Sarkar will speak with industry professionals at Two Sigma about how the topics of our other two courses are utilized in the field. Parallel, concurrent, and distributed programming underlies software in multiple domains, ranging from biomedical research to financial services. This specialization is intended for anyone with a basic knowledge of sequential programming in Java, who is motivated to learn how to write parallel, concurrent and distributed programs. Through a collection of three courses (which may be taken in any order or separately), you will learn foundational topics in Parallelism, Concurrency, and Distribution. These courses will prepare you for multithreaded and distributed programming for a wide range of computer platforms, from mobile devices to cloud computing servers.

Our trainers, equipped with expert industry experience and an unparalleled commitment to quality, facilitate classes that are offered in various delivery formats so our clients can obtain the training they need when and where they need it. This module provides an overview of the Core Java - Java Class Library course.  There are over 4200 classes in the Java 8 class library, with hundreds of new ones compared to prior versions of Java.  In this course, we will cover additional language features that enable the class library, essential library areas, and provide roadmaps to areas for self-exploration. In this module, we will learn about a major Java feature, Generics (known as template or parameterized types in some other languages), introduced in Java 5.  Generics are a key tool in ensuring type safety. In this module, we'll talk about the Java Collection classes, which were introduced in Java 5 and have been expanded upon in Java 8 with the introduction of Java Streams (java.util.stream) technology.  Collections give us much more power and capability for managing collections of data than the simple, linear, arrays we have used up to this point in the curricula. Different programming models handle error conditions in different ways.  Some, for example, require programmers to check error codes after every function call. Java, learning from other environments such as C++, takes a different approach known as exception handling.  In this module, you will learn how Java deals with exceptions, and learn to both handle and -- when necessary -- create exceptions. Java has rich Input and Output (I/O) capabilities, which have evolved constantly over the years.  Java can handle network I/O, file I/O blocking and non-blocking I/O and more.  In this module we will look at an overview of I/O, and focus mostly on simple text I/O using files.  We will also take a brief look at the extensive improvements made to I/O in Java 7 and Java 8, with readings to provide additional information. Java Enums provide us with the ability to create a fixed set of constant values.  They are objects, so they can have methods and properties, but they are a fixed, constant, set, nonetheless.  The simplest ones might merely be something like the suits of a deck of cards, but we'll take a more complete look at their capabilities, and how you might use them. Annotations are a way of attaching meta-data to Java code.  Added in Java 5, this passive meta-data facility might not seem important at first, but is the key to how modern Java frameworks work.  Spring, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, NetFlix OSS, Java Persistence Architecture, Jakarta EE (née Java EE) containers, JAX-WS, JAX-RS, and so many others.  In this module, we will look at the Java Annotations technology, look at existing annotations, and -- in the lab -- create a custom annotation, and write code to see that annotation at run-time.  This means that you will not only have the ability to use annotations, but also have at least the rudiments necessary to write and process your own annotations, such you have the need. This Core Java Specialization is part of a series of programming specializations, derived from LearnQuest's private Java Bootcamps, designed to provide the skill set necessary to be hired as an IT developer using Java in many corporate environments. To be successful in this specialization, we recommend you have an understanding of the fundamentals of software development in any language. LearnQuest offers a beginning programmer specialization that can help you prepare.  In the four courses of this specialization, you’ll quickly master the Java programming language and the packages that constitute its rich set of core libraries. We’ll provide hands-on exercises so you can practice your new skills.  In Course 1, we’ll introduce you to the basic fundamentals of the Java language.  Course 2 provides a refresher on object-oriented programming, and how you can apply OO to Java. We’ll introduce Java classes, instances and packaging.  By the time you get to course 3, you’ll be ready to go deeper into applying OOP concepts in Java, including inheritance and polymorphism.  In course 4 you’ll learn how to use selected parts of the Java SE Class LIbrary, including Generics, Collections, Java Streams, I/O, Exceptions, Annotations and Enums.  While we'll touch on other important Java topics, such as database connectivity, Java EE and Spring, those topics are covered in greater detail in other LearnQuest Java Specializations. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:20h:1|2;Java

Or how Amazon recommends books? We can get a feel for how it works by building a simplified recommender of our own! In this capstone, you will show off your problem solving and Java programming skills by creating recommender systems. You will work with data for movies, including ratings, but the principles involved can easily be adapted to books, restaurants, and more. You will write a program to answer questions about the data, including which items should be recommended to a user based on their ratings of several movies. Given input files on users ratings and movie titles, you will be able to:  1. Read in and parse data into lists and maps 2. Calculate average ratings 3. Calculate how similar a given rater is to another user based on ratings and 4. Recommend movies to a given user based on ratings.  5. Display recommended movies for a given user on a webpage.

The university has a strong commitment to applying knowledge in service to society, both near its North Carolina campus and around the world. You will start out the capstone project by taking a look at the features of a recommender engine. Then you will choose how to read in and organize user, ratings, and movie data in your program. The programming exercise will provide a check on your progress before moving on to the next step. Your second step in building a recommender will focus on making simple recommendations based on the average ratings that a movie receives. You'll also make sure that each recommended movie has a least a minimal number of user ratings before including it in your recommendations. Throughout this step you are encouraged you use your knowledge of the seven step process to design useful algorithms and successful programs to solve the challenges you will face. In your third step, you will be encouraged to use interfaces to rewrite your existing code, making it more flexible and more efficient. You will also add filters to select a desired subset of movies that you want to recommend, such as 'all movies under two hours long' or 'all movies made in 2012'. You'll also make your recommendation engine more efficient as you practice software design principles such as refactoring. In your fourth step, you will complete your recommendation engine by finding users in the database that have similar ratings and weighting their input to provide a more personal recommendation for the users of your program. Once you complete this step, you could request ratings of movies from those you know, run your program, and give them recommendations tailored to their own interests and tastes! Congratulations on completing your recommender programming project! As we conclude this capstone course, our instructors have a few parting words as you embark in future learning and work in computer science!

In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI. This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.

Welcome to Machine Learning! In this module, we introduce the core idea of teaching a computer to learn concepts using data—without being explicitly programmed. The Course Wiki is under construction. Please visit the resources tab for the most complete and up-to-date information. Linear regression predicts a real-valued output based on an input value. We discuss the application of linear regression to housing price prediction, present the notion of a cost function, and introduce the gradient descent method for learning. This optional module provides a refresher on linear algebra concepts. Basic understanding of linear algebra is necessary for the rest of the course, especially as we begin to cover models with multiple variables. What if your input has more than one value? In this module, we show how linear regression can be extended to accommodate multiple input features. We also discuss best practices for implementing linear regression. This course includes programming assignments designed to help you understand how to implement the learning algorithms in practice. To complete the programming assignments, you will need to use Octave or MATLAB. This module introduces Octave/Matlab and shows you how to submit an assignment. Logistic regression is a method for classifying data into discrete outcomes. For example, we might use logistic regression to classify an email  as spam or not spam. In this module, we introduce the notion of classification, the cost function for logistic regression, and the application of logistic regression to multi-class classification. Machine learning models need to generalize well to new examples that the model has not seen in practice. In this module, we introduce regularization, which helps prevent models from overfitting the training data.  Neural networks is a model inspired by how the brain works. It is widely used today in many applications: when your phone interprets and understand your voice commands, it is likely that a neural network is helping to understand your speech when you cash a check, the machines that automatically read the digits also use neural networks.  In this module, we introduce the backpropagation algorithm that is used to help learn parameters for a neural network. At the end of this module, you will be implementing your own neural network for digit recognition. Applying machine learning in practice is not always straightforward. In this module, we share best practices for applying machine learning in practice, and discuss the best ways to evaluate performance of the learned models. To optimize a machine learning algorithm, you’ll need to first understand where the biggest improvements can be made. In this module, we discuss how to understand the performance of a machine learning system with multiple parts, and also how to deal with skewed data. Support vector machines, or SVMs, is a machine learning algorithm for classification. We introduce the idea and intuitions behind SVMs and discuss how to use it in practice. We use unsupervised learning to build models that help us understand our data better. We discuss the k-Means algorithm for clustering that enable us to learn groupings of unlabeled data points. In this module, we introduce Principal Components Analysis, and show how it can be used for data compression to speed up learning algorithms as well as for visualizations of complex datasets. Given a large number of data points, we may sometimes want to figure out which ones vary significantly from the average. For example, in manufacturing, we may want to detect defects or anomalies. We show how a dataset can be modeled using a Gaussian distribution, and how the model can be used for anomaly detection. When you buy a product online, most websites automatically recommend other products that you may like. Recommender systems look at patterns of activities between different users and different products to produce these recommendations. In this module, we introduce recommender algorithms such as the collaborative filtering algorithm and low-rank matrix factorization. Machine learning works best when there is an abundance of data to leverage for training. In this module, we discuss how to apply the machine learning algorithms with large datasets. Identifying and recognizing objects, words, and digits in an image is a challenging task. We discuss how a pipeline can be built to tackle this problem and how to analyze and improve the performance of such a system. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:10h:1|2;Algorithms

Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish The Leland Stanford Junior University, commonly referred to as Stanford University or Stanford, is an American private research university located in Stanford, California on an 8,180-acre (3,310 ha) campus near Palo Alto, California, United States. Week 1.  This week's topic is an overview of what cryptography is about as well as our first example ciphers. You will learn about pseudo-randomness and how to use it for encryption. We will also look at a few basic definitions of secure encryption.  Week 2. We introduce a new primitive called a block cipher that will let us build more powerful forms of encryption. We will look at a few classic block-cipher constructions (AES and 3DES) and see how to use them for encryption. Block ciphers are the work horse of cryptography and have many applications. Next week we will see how to use block ciphers to provide data integrity. The optional programming assignment this week asks students to build an encryption/decryption system using AES.  Week 3. This week's topic is data integrity.  We will discuss a number of classic constructions for MAC systems that are used to ensure data integrity. For now we only discuss how to prevent modification of non-secret data. Next week we will come back to encryption and show how to provide both confidentiality and integrity. This week's programming project shows how to authenticate large video files. Even if you don't do the project, please read the project description --- it teaches an important concept called a hash chain. Week 4. This week's topic is authenticated encryption: encryption methods that ensure both confidentiality and integrity. We will also discuss a few odds and ends such as how to search on encrypted data. This is our last week studying symmetric encryption. Next week we start with key management and public-key cryptography. As usual there is also an extra credit programming project. This week's project involves a bit of networking to experiment with a chosen ciphertext attack on a toy web site. Week 5.  This week's topic is basic key exchange: how to setup a secret key between two parties. For now we only consider protocols secure against eavesdropping. This question motivates the main concepts of public key cryptography, but before we build public-key systems we need to take a brief detour and cover a few basic concepts from computational number theory. We will start with algorithms dating back to antiquity (Euclid) and work our way up to Fermat, Euler, and Legendre. We will also mention in passing a few useful concepts from 20th century math. Next week we will put our hard work from this week to good use and construct several public key encryption systems.  Week 6. This week's topic is public key encryption: how to encrypt using a public key and decrypt using a secret key. Public key encryption is used for key management in encrypted file systems, in encrypted messaging systems, and for many other tasks. The videos cover two families of public key encryption systems: one based on trapdoor functions (RSA in particular) and the other based on the Diffie-Hellman protocol. We construct systems that are secure against tampering, also known as chosen ciphertext security (CCA security). There has been a ton of research on CCA security over the past decade and given the allotted time we can only summarize the main results from the last few years. The lectures contain suggestions for further readings for those interested in learning more about CCA secure public-key systems. The problem set this week involves a bit more math than usual, but should expand your understanding of public-key encryption. Please don't be shy about posting questions in the forum. This is the last week of this Crypto I course. I hope everyone learned a lot and enjoyed the material. Crypto is a beautiful topic with lots of open problems and room for further research. I look forward to seeing you in Crypto II where we will cover additional core topics and a few more advanced topics.  Congratulations!   We are at the end of the course.  This module contains only the final exam which covers the entire course. I hope everyone learned a lot during these 6 weeks. Good luck on the final exam and I look forward to seeing you at a future course!     ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:20h:1|2;Algorithms

The web is a very big place, and if you are the typical internet user, you probably visit several websites every day, whether for business, entertainment or education. But have you ever wondered how these websites actually work? How are they built? How do browsers, computers, and mobile devices interact with the web? What skills are necessary to build a website? With almost 1 billion websites now on the internet, the answers to these questions could be your first step toward a better understanding of the internet and developing a new set of internet skills.   By the end of this course you’ll be able to describe the structure and functionality of the world wide web, create dynamic web pages using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, apply essential programming language concepts when creating HTML forms, select an appropriate web hosting service, and publish your webpages for the world to see. Finally, you’ll be able to develop a working model for creating your own personal or business websites in the future and be fully prepared to take the next step in a more advanced web development or design course or specialization.

With four colleges and six professional schools, UC Davis and its students and alumni are known for their academic excellence, meaningful public service and profound international impact. This first module provides an overview of how websites function, their structure, and the ins and outs of choosing a website name and selecting an online host to house your website. By the end of this module, you'll be able to: find and select a web hosting company choose an effective domain name use the host to manage your websites and discuss how networks and the internet function at a high level. In this module, we'll begin to explore how to design and create websites by exploring the base language used to power all websites: HTML. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to: identify and use common HTML tags add an image to a webpage create HTML-formatted tables use hyperlinks to connect a series of webpages upload your finished HTML pages to a web host and, learn some tips and tricks for styling pages and practicing your coding. Now that you know some basic HTML, it's time to turn our attention to another common scripting language used to make websites dynamic - that is allowing users to interact with your webpages - JavaScript. While learning about JavaScript, you'll also gain some foundational knowledge common to all programming languages. By the end of this module, you'll be able to: discuss what is meant by dynamic content perform essential programming language tasks create simple JavaScript programs use JavaScript to set up alerts and respond to events, to read input, and to change HTML and conduct basic JavaScript testing. While HTML and JavaScript are very useful for web development, they don't exactly make websites look attractive - that's where cascading style sheets, or CSS, comes into play. While HTML is used to build the structure of our pages and JavaScript is used to provide interactive functionality, CSS is used to graphically design and layout webpages. By the end of this module, you'll be able to: discuss common mistakes in designing a website identify and apply CSS basics like purpose and syntax use CSS properties to control fonts, colors, layouts, and other common properties differentiate between in-line, internal, and external CSS and practice and test your cascading style sheets. In this lesson, we're going to learn to apply all of the skills we've acquired so far to make a very common, and very useful type of webpage - an HTML form. HTML forms are seen everywhere on the internet and are used to capture particular information from users in a variety of ways. By the end of this module you'll be able to: create basic HTML forms identify and appropriately use different types of HTML input validate user input submit HTML forms and test how your forms are working and troubleshoot errors. In our final module, we're going to explore the basics of designing web applications - programming useful and dynamic webpages that allow our users to interact with them. By the end of this lesson you'll be able to: distinguish between client and server-side development apply advanced JavaScript programming skills to create logic with selection and iteration create new features for applications create more advanced HTML forms and practice and learn additional troubleshooting and problem-solving techniques. The module wraps with a final peer review activity that will draw upon all of the skills you've learned in this course. ;10;1;1;Długość kursu:12h:1|2;Web Development

But what if you actually want to understand how the page was created? There are great textbooks and online resources for learning web design, but most of those resources require some background knowledge. This course is designed to help the novice who wants to gain confidence and knowledge. We will explore the theory (what actually happens when you click on a link on a webpage?), the practical (what do I need to know to make my own page?), and the overlooked (I have a page, what do I do now?). Throughout the course there will be a strong emphasis on adhering to syntactic standards for validation and semantic standards to promote wide accessibility for users with disabilities.  The textbook we use is available online, “The Missing Link: An Introduction to Web Development and Programming” by Michael Mendez from www.opensuny.org.  This course will appeal to a wide variety of people, but specifically those who would like a step-by-step description of the basics. There are no prerequisites for this course and it is assumed that students have no prior programming skills or IT experience. The course will culminate in a small final project that will require the completion of a very simple page with links and images. The focus of this course is on the basics, not appearance. You can see a sample final page at http://intro-webdesign.com/html5-plain.html.    This is the first course in the Web Design For Everybody specialization. Subsequent courses focus on the marketable skills of styling the page with CSS3, adding interactivity with JavaScript and enhancing the styling with responsive design.

This week we will uncover the mystery behind the Internet.  What happens when you type a URL into your browser so that a webpage magically appears?  What is HTML5 and what happened to HTML 1 - 4?  We will also cover some practical concepts that you need to master before you begin coding your own pages.  This week you will need to take a deep breath and jump into coding.  I will cover a large number of HTML tags, but it is important that you do more than just listen to these video and read the text book material.  You need to practice (and fail!) in order to learn.     Believe it or not, once you master the basic idea of using tags and attributes you will know everything you need to use any HTML5 tag.  The page may not look the way you want it to look yet, but you will be able to  use text, links, images, tables, and even music and videos!    If you want to refer to a textbook this week for reinforcement of concepts, we will be using the Shay Howe online textbook as a reference.  I will include links after the lectures, but some students prefer to read before the videos.  (My preferred approach is to read/watch/read again.) Okay, you created a file...what now?  This week we will begin by covering the important but often overlooked concepts of validation and accessibility.  Did you follow the DOM structure when you created your page?  Did you use semantic tags to make sure that page viewers can access all of the information, even if they have physical or cognitive disabilities?   This is knowledge you can use if you would like to pursue a career as a web accessibility specialist.  Finally I will briefly cover the steps needed to post your site to the web.  There are many free and paid services that you can use to get your work off your computer and on to the Internet.   This Specialization covers how to write syntactically correct HTML5 and CSS3, and how to create interactive web experiences with JavaScript. Mastering this range of technologies will allow you to develop high quality web sites that, work seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and large screen browsers accessible. During the capstone you will develop a professional-quality web portfolio demonstrating your growth as a web developer and your knowledge of accessible web design. This will include your ability to design and implement a responsive site that utilizes tools to create a site that is accessible to a wide audience, including those with visual, audial, physical, and cognitive impairments. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:39h:1|2;Web Development

Along the way you’ll also gain useful skills for which competitive programmers are so highly valued by employers: ability to write efficient, reliable, and compact code, manage your time well when it’s limited, apply basic algorithmic ideas to real problems, etc. We start from the very beginning by teaching you what competitions there are, what are their rules, what specifics problems have, how to read problem statements, how to organize your work, and what you should and shouldn’t do. So it’s fine if you’ve never taken part in programming competitions before.  We’ll focus on skills essential to competitive programming: inventing solutions and proving their correctness, estimating their running time, testing and debugging programs, how to benefit from structuring code. We’ll also cover basic algorithmic ideas: brute force search, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, segment trees.  On competitions, there are a lot of specific pitfalls, perilous to beginners — but that’s not to worry, as we’ll go through the most common of them: integer overflow and issues with fractional numbers, troubles of particular programming languages, how to get unstuck in general.  And, you’ll hone all these skills by solving practice problems, which are just like problems on real competitions. You could use any of the following programming languages: C, C++, CSharp, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Python 2, Python 3, Ruby, Rust, Scala.

In a separate lesson, we'll learn how to test programs: what kinds of test cases there are, how to organize the search for a bugtest, and particularly a method of automating testing called stress-testing. In this module, we'll start with the most basic things you need to actually solve algorithmic problems. First, we'll talk about structuring your code and intuition behind it — why it's very important, how to manage dependencies between parts of different purpose, how intuitive rules are enforced through formal invariants and conditions. We'll also identify a special class of solutions — brute force solutions — which are always correct, but often very slow. And we'll learn how to estimate running time of our solutions by using a powerful concept of big-O notation. In competitive programming, there are a lot of things to stumble upon — if you don't know them first! We'll delve into how numbers are represented in computers, identify the most common issues with integer and floating point arithmetic, and learn to overcome them. We'll also discuss how to get stuck less in general, especially when debugging solutions. We continue considering common struggles arising in competitive programming. We start by learning how to prove that a natural greedy algorithm is correct. We also discuss programming languages: what features are most helpful on competitions, and what are the advantages and pitfalls of several frequently used languages. Finally, we study an essential and easy-to-implement data structure: the segment tree. Dynamic programming is a powerful algorithmic paradigm with lots of applications in areas like optimisation, scheduling, planning, bioinformatics, and others. For this reason, it is not surprising that it is the most popular type of problems in competitive programming. A common feature of such problems is that a solution is usually easy to implement. This does not however mean that it is also easy to find a solution! Therefore, it is important to practice solving such problems. And this is exactly what we are going to do in this module! We continue applying dynamic programming technique to various problems. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:15h:1|2;Java

Now, sites are designed with complex layouts, unique fonts, and customized color schemes.   This course will show you the basics of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3).  The emphasis will be on learning how to write CSS rules, how to test code, and how to establish good programming habits.      When done correctly, the styling of a webpage can take enhance your page.   When done incorrectly the result can be worse than no styling at all.    To ensure that your sites do not put up  barriers for people with cognitive and/or physical disabilities, you will learn how to evaluate pages using the standardized POUR accessibility guidelines.    Upon completion of the course, learners will be able to sketch a design for a given HTML page.  Using that design they will use CSS to implement the design by adding fonts, colors, and  layouts.      This is the second course in the Web Design For Everybody specialization.   Subsequent courses focus on adding interaction with JavaScript and enhancing the styling with responsive design.  It will be difficult to complete this course if you do not have access to a laptop or desktop computer for the homework.

Welcome to Introduction to CSS3!  In this course you will learn how to style your pages by taking advantage of the power of CSS3.   We will focus on both proper syntax (how to write your styling rules) and the importance of accessibility design (making sure that your style enhances your site, not make it harder to navigate).  It is so important that you jump in ready to make mistakes and typos in this course.  The only way you will really understand the material is to practice typing it in on your own as often as possible. Colors and fonts are just the start to styling your page.  The nice thing about starting with these properties is that they are usually very straightforward to implement.  You pick a color and boom - instant, expected results.  This week we move on to new properties that tend to require a little bit of tweaking to get the desired results.  In particular we will talk about the Box Model, background images, opacity, float, columns, visibility, and designing for different browsers. Have you ever noticed on a web page that some links are blue and others are purple, depending upon if you have clicked on the links?  How is it possible to style some anchor tags and not others?  This week you will learn how to style pseudo-classes (e.g. a link that has been visiting, an element that has the mouse hovering over it) and pseudo-elements (e.g. the first-letter of a heading, the first line of a paragraph).  These elements are not difficult to style, but do require careful coding.  It is also the first step to adding simple animation to your site.  We end this week with the subject of positioning -- how to get elements to stick to a certain part of your page.  Think about annoying pop-up ads.  How do the programmers get them to stay RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN despite the fact that you keep trying to scroll them away. This week I am going to do some code review.  I will show you how I used pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements to style a table.  Then I give you a demonstration of three different navigation bars that utilize different styling options.   We will want to step back and talk about how these different options may affect the accessibility of our site.  The final step to completing this course is the completion of the peer-graded project.  You will have the chance to demonstrate the ability to follow styling guidelines while still putting your own personal touch on the project.  Just remember, you need to validate your work for proper syntax and accessibility. If you would like to do more now that you have finished this course, I have a few recommendations.  The most important thing is that you continue to practice your skills and always have something that you are working on. This Specialization covers how to write syntactically correct HTML5 and CSS3, and how to create interactive web experiences with JavaScript. Mastering this range of technologies will allow you to develop high quality web sites that, work seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and large screen browsers accessible. During the capstone you will develop a professional-quality web portfolio demonstrating your growth as a web developer and your knowledge of accessible web design. This will include your ability to design and implement a responsive site that utilizes tools to create a site that is accessible to a wide audience, including those with visual, audial, physical, and cognitive impairments. ;10;1;1;Długość kursu:34h:1|2;Web Development

Then consider joining this course to gain skills in one of the most popular Single Page Application (SPA) frameworks today, AngularJS. Developed and backed by Google, AngularJS is a very marketable skill to acquire. In this course, we will explore the core design of AngularJS 1.x (latest version of AngularJS 1), its components and code organization techniques. We will enhance the functionality of our web app by utilizing dependency injection to reuse existing services as well as write our own. We will create reusable HTML components that take advantage of AngularJS data binding as well as extend HTML syntax with a very powerful feature of AngularJS called directives. We’ll set up routing so our SPA can have multiple views. We will also learn how to unit test our functionality. At the end of this course, you will build a fully functional, well organized and tested web application using AngularJS and deploy it to the cloud.

In this module, we are going to start by going over how grading works for this course, will introduce some recommended books, as well as give you the information on how to find all of the source code that you will see throughout the course. We will then dive into the development environment setup for both Mac and Windows. The core of this module will be the introduction not only to the basics of AngularJS, but more importantly, the concepts that back AngularJS as a good solution for developing front-end web applications.  To become a good software developer and not just with AngularJS, you will need to understand these concepts. But for becoming a good AngularJS developer, these concepts are essential, because they will allow you to understand the issues the framework is addressing and therefore get a good grasp on the solutions AngularJS is offering. We will start this module by learning how to use Angular filters to manipulate our data into the format we want and learn how to create our own custom filters. We will then dive deep into the digest cycle, which is the process AngularJS uses to magically update our web page with the bound data from our ViewModel or the controller. Understanding this process is crucial in getting comfortable with AngularJS. We'll also see some cases where we'll need to assist that process somewhat and understand why that is. After that, we'll learn one of the most fundamental concepts in the Javascript programming language, which is Prototypal Inheritance. Clear understanding of that topic is a must before we talk about inheritance between AngularJS controllers in our application. We'll finish off the module by learning how to create our own custom Angular services as well as how to configure them. With custom Angular services we'll be able to share data across different controllers or other components in our application. We will also learn a few useful Angular directives that allow us to place looping and conditional logic direction into our HTML. You'll see that by the end of this module, you'll have the skills to create a fairly sophisticated web application that starts to use some of the more advanced software architecture techniques. Welcome to module 3! In this module, we go over a lot of essential features of AngularJS. We will start with learning about the Promise API. While Promises are essential to Angular, this topic reaches far beyond Angular. It's really an essential topic to understanding modern web development with Javascript. We will also learn about making calls to the server through the built in Angular service called the HTTP service. We'll finish off the module by spending a considerable amount of time on THE crown feature of AngularJS: directives. Directives are really at the core of the entire framework. They not only allow us to extend the functionality of existing HTML elements, which is already pretty amazing in an of itself, but they also allow us to create our own element with custom view and custom behavior. Pretty exciting stuff!  In this module, we start by introducing the idea of Component-based architecture. We will then delve into the AngularJS component API. The component API is something that was just recently added into Angular 1 and it's not only supposed to improve your application through the use of Component-based architecture, but also prepare you for an upgrade to Angular version 2, which uses components almost exclusively. We will then learn about the AngularJS event system and how to split up our application into smaller modules that can then be glued together to produce our final application. We'll finish off the module by diving fairly deep into Routing between views in your application and, specifically, into the use of the ui-router module, which is one of the most popular open source routing solutions within the AngularJS ecosystem. In fact, it's so popular that even the main Google documentation for routing in Angular links to ui-router. Routing is a very important topic. Without it, your Single Page Application is stuck displaying just 1 view, without an elegant way to display other views. Welcome to module 5! This is the last module in the course. We'll start this module by learning just how easy it is to validate forms with Angular. We will then delve into unit testing our AngularJS code. We will go over how to set up tests for every type of major Angular artifact: controller, service, directive, and component, as well as how to test services that access the network through the HTTP service. However, the last part of the module is the most fun. We will take the site that was developed for our real client in my previous course and re-write the entire thing using AngularJS. However, the coding fun doesn't have to stop there. After you finish the required part of the course, you can move on to the optional bonus part where we take our newly developed AngularJS application and enhance with it even more features that will allow the restaurant owners to administer their own data. We'll go over setting up authentication, editing restaurant menu items, uploading menu item pictures and so on. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:34h:1|2;Web Development

Первая неделя курса посвящена знакомству с HTML. Вы узнаете, откуда взялся этот язык разметки, как он развивается сегодня, из чего состоят HTML-элементы и как разметить ими обычный текст. На второй неделе мы продолжим изучение HTML. Вы узнаете, что такое семантическая разметка и почему важно соблюдать семантику. Научитесь создавать ссылки в HTML-документе. Не обойдёмся и без практики: вам предстоит попрактиковаться в разметке текста. Поговорим о том, почему появился CSS, и разберёмся в его структуре. Вы научитесь грамотно применять и комбинировать различные типы селекторов (селекторы тегов, классов, идентификаторов и атрибутов). Также мы расскажем, что такое псевдоэлементы и псведоклассы, какие они бывают и как с ними работать. Вы разберётесь в том, что такое специфичность, как она высчитывается и как это влияет на порядок применения свойств в CSS. Четвёртая неделя курса посвящена работе со шрифтами и текстом. Вы узнаете о проблемах, связанных с использованием нестандартных шрифтов, и способах их решения. Научитесь управлять выводом шрифтов, применять цвет для текста, а ещё создавать интересные эффекты с помощью тени. Узнаете, как реализовать многоколоночную развёртку, а также как грамотно обходить проблему переполнения текста. Полученных навыков вам хватит, чтобы сверстать собственную газету. На пятой неделе вы узнаете про основные виды трансформаций и о том, как создать анимации только при помощи CSS. Разумеется, попрактикуетесь в создании анимаций разных уровней сложности. Пройдя эту специализацию, вы освоите основные инструменты разработчика интерфейсов. Если всё получится, через 5 месяцев вы сможете работать младшим фронтендером. Специализация состоит из двух частей: два курса про вёрстку и ещё два по JavaScript. Курсы про вёрстку не требуют практически никакой подготовки. Научиться основам JavaScript труднее, поэтому кое-какая подготовка нужна: преподаватели ожидают, что вы уже умеете программировать на каком-нибудь объектно-ориентированном или функциональном языке (например, C++, CSharp, Java, Python или Haskell).

In this course, we consider the common data structures that are used in various computational problems. You will learn how these data structures are implemented in different programming languages and will practice implementing them in our programming assignments. This will help you to understand what is going on inside a particular built-in implementation of a data structure and what to expect from it. You will also learn typical use cases for these data structures. A few examples of questions that we are going to cover in this class are the following: 1. What is a good strategy of resizing a dynamic array? 2. How priority queues are implemented in C++, Java, and Python? 3. How to implement a hash table so that the amortized running time of all operations is O(1) on average? 4. What are good strategies to keep a binary tree balanced?

Learn more on www.hse.ru In this module, you will learn about the basic data structures used throughout the rest of this course.  We start this module by looking in detail at the fundamental building blocks: arrays and linked lists. From there, we build up two important data structures: stacks and queues. Next, we look at trees: examples of how they’re used in Computer Science, how they’re implemented, and the various ways they can be traversed. Once you’ve completed this module, you will be able to implement any of these data structures, as well as have a solid understanding of the costs of the operations, as well as the tradeoffs involved in using each data structure. In this module, we discuss Dynamic Arrays: a way of using arrays when it is unknown ahead-of-time how many elements will be needed. Here, we also discuss amortized analysis: a method of determining the amortized cost of an operation over a sequence of operations. Amortized analysis is very often used to analyse performance of algorithms when the straightforward analysis produces unsatisfactory results, but amortized analysis helps to show that the algorithm is actually efficient. It is used both for Dynamic Arrays analysis and will also be used in the end of this course to analyze Splay trees. We start this module by considering priority queues which are used to efficiently schedule jobs, either in the context of a computer operating system or in real life, to sort huge files, which is the most important building block for any Big Data processing algorithm, and to efficiently compute shortest paths in graphs, which is a topic we will cover in our next course. For this reason, priority queues have built-in implementations in many programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python. We will see that these implementations are based on a beautiful idea of storing a complete binary tree in an array that allows to implement all priority queue methods in just few lines of code. We will then switch to disjoint sets data structure that is used, for example, in dynamic graph connectivity and image processing. We will see again how simple and natural ideas lead to an implementation that is both easy to code and very efficient. By completing this module, you will be able to implement both these data structures efficiently from scratch. In this module you will learn about very powerful and widely used technique called hashing. Its applications include implementation of programming languages, file systems, pattern search, distributed key-value storage and many more. You will learn how to implement data structures to store and modify sets of objects and mappings from one type of objects to another one. You will see that naive implementations either consume huge amount of memory or are slow, and then you will learn to implement hash tables that use linear memory and work in O(1) on average! In the end, you will learn how hash functions are used in modern disrtibuted systems and how they are used to optimize storage of services like Dropbox, Google Drive and Yandex Disk! In this module we study binary search trees, which are a data structure for doing searches on dynamically changing ordered sets. You will learn about many of the difficulties in accomplishing this task and the ways in which we can overcome them. In order to do this you will need to learn the basic structure of binary search trees, how to insert and delete without destroying this structure, and how to ensure that the tree remains balanced. In this module we continue studying binary search trees. We study a few non-trivial applications. We then study the new kind of balanced search trees - Splay Trees. They adapt to the queries dynamically and are optimal in many ways. Computer science legend Donald Knuth once said “I don’t understand things unless I try to program them.” We also believe that the best way to learn an algorithm is to program it. However, many excellent books and online courses on algorithms, that excel in introducing algorithmic ideas, have not yet succeeded in teaching you how to implement algorithms, the crucial computer science skill that you have to master at your next job interview. We tried to fill this gap by forming a diverse team of instructors that includes world-leading experts in theoretical and applied algorithms at UCSD (Daniel Kane, Alexander Kulikov, and Pavel Pevzner), a chief data scientist at Yandex (Michael Levin), and a former software engineer at Google (Neil Rhodes). This unique combination of skills makes this Specialization different from other excellent MOOCs on algorithms that are all developed by theoretical computer scientists. While these MOOCs focus on theory, our Specialization is a mix of algorithmic theory/practice/applications with software engineering. You will learn algorithms by implementing nearly 100 coding problems in a programming language of your choice. To the best of knowledge, no other online course in Algorithms comes close to offering you a wealth of programming challenges (and puzzles!) that you may face at your next job interview. We invested over 3000 hours into designing our challenges as an alternative to multiple choice questions that you usually find in MOOCs. ;10;1;1;Długość kursu:10h:1|2;Algorithms

This means less operational overhead for you and your business, and more focusing on the applications and business specific projects that differentiate you in your marketplace. In this course, we will be covering how to build a modern, greenfield serverless backend on AWS.  Building brand new applications on AWS is a different task than lifting and shifting existing applications into AWS. When you have an existing application that you need to move to AWS, you might first look to using Amazon EC2 as your virtual machines, or maybe you might look into using docker containers and container hosting services like Amazon Elastic Container Service or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service. Those are all great application hosting options, but in most cases, they still require you to have some kind of pulse on the underlying infrastructure hosting your application.  `  Building Modern Node.js Applications on AWS will explore how to build an API driven application using Amazon API Gateway for serverless API hosting, AWS Lambda for serverless computing, and Amazon Cognito for serverless authentication. We will follow an API driven development process and first mock up what the API will look like. We will cover all the ins and outs of the service Amazon API Gateway, and as you’ll learn- it does a lot more than just hosting an API.   Then we will add authentication to the API using Amazon Cognito. You’ll learn about how the authorization flow works with Cognito, and how to build it into your APIs. From there, we will add a Lambda backend that will be triggered by API Gateway. The lambda functions will be using the AWS SDKs to perform various data processing tasks. You’ll learn about the different configurations that exist for Lambda, and we will show you how to create and manage lambda functions. Some of the features of our API will require multiple lambda functions to execute in a specific order, like a workflow, and we will use AWS Step Functions to create a serverless workflow. Finally, we will talk about how to optimize your APIs at every layer using AWS features.  Note: There are three versions of this class, Building Modern Node.js Applications on AWS for Node.js developers, Building Modern Python Applications on AWS for Python developers, and Building Modern Java Applications on AWS for Java developers.  The courses do for a large part, overlap and in general, we recommend that you take the course that focuses on the SDK you plan to use to develop your AWS Cloud based applications.  We expect that you have basic knowledge of AWS already. Some examples of concepts you should be familiar with are: you should know the basics of the AWS Global infrastructure, like what regions and availability zones are. You also should know the at a high-level AWS Identity and Access Management, or IAM, and how it is used to control access to AWS resources. You should also understand what an Amazon EC2 instance is, what Amazon S3 is, what a VPC is, as well as other basic AWS terminology. Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Since 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. AWS offers over 90 fully featured services for compute, storage, networking, database, analytics, application services, deployment, management, developer, mobile, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence, security, hybrid and enterprise applications, from 44 Availability Zones across 16 geographic regions.  AWS services are trusted by millions of active customers around the world — including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies — to power their infrastructure, make them more agile, and lower costs.  Coursera and AWS have been partners since 2017 providing learners and enterprises globally, the skills they need to succeed.  Coursera builds on AWS servers to scale with student demand with confidence around capacity and elasticity and in partnership with AWS.  In 2019, Coursera achieved Advanced Tier Partner status and further extended the partnership with AWS Educate, AWS EdStart and AWS Academy collaborations.   Coursera's been able to make cloud skills more accessible with 8 AWS courses on the Coursera platform featuring top subject matter experts and the portfolio continues to grow.    To learn more about AWS, visit https://aws.amazon.com. This specialization is designed to help you master the skills of designing and building cloud-native applications on AWS. We begin with the foundational technical and cloud knowledge that you need to have to build in the AWS Cloud. In the first course, you will be introduced to several AWS compute services, different storage and database offerings that AWS provides, AWS’ networking capabilities, monitoring capabilities and the AWS IAM service. The second course in the specialization explores how to build an API driven application using Amazon API Gateway for serverless API hosting, AWS Lambda for serverless computing, and Amazon Cognito for serverless authentication.  Modern applications require a modern database. Hence, the third course introduces you to NoSQL databases and the challenges they solve. We will dive deep into Amazon DynamoDB topics such as recovery, SDKs, partition keys, security and encryption, global tables, stateless applications, streams, and best practices. Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.  Note: There are 4 versions of this specialization.

This course will give you the basic background, terminology and fundamental concepts that you need to understand in order to build modern full stack web applications. A full stack web developer is familiar with each layer  of the software technologies involved in a web application, including data modeling and database technologies, the web server environment and middleware components, network protocols, the user interface and basic visual design and user interaction concepts.  In this course we will learn by doing.  We will start by learning the major components of web application architectures, along with the fundamental design patterns and philosophies that are used to organize them.  You will build and continually refine a fully functional full-stack web application as we progress through the modules in this course.  Along the way you will be exposed to agile software development practices, numerous tools that software engineers are expected to know how to use, and a modern web application development framework.

We empower our students to lead in tackling complex societal challenges, offering an exceptional education inspired by vision, scholarship, and creativity. UNM’s distinctive campus environment blend of culture and cuisine, styles and stories, people, pursuits and panoramas. This module sets the context for what we will study in this specialization by first providing a historical perspective on computing and web applications.  Next we provide an overview of how the Internet works, and then we discuss how web applications have evolved over the past few decades. After that we’ll discuss some of the elements of modern software practice, including the typical tools that software engineers now use and the agile development practices they follow. The notion of software design patterns will introduced, and the n-tier architecture design pattern, fundamental to modern web application design, is then presented. Will also discuss a few current topics related to web application development. Finally, we will show you how to set up the software development environment you will use throughout the remainder of the courses in this.  In this module you will learn about web application frameworks. We will start by talking about the evolution of software and programming languages, and then talk about software application frameworks.  The fundamental trade-off we will consider is programmer productivity versus program efficiency.  Next you will learn about web application frameworks, as well as the model-view-controller design pattern that is the backbone for many of these frameworks.  We will also consider how these frameworks support the agile programming principles associated with modern software practice. This will include a discussion of distributed version control systems and you will learn how to use the popular Git system.  We will also demonstrate how to use Git with a Ruby on Rails application.  We will use Git to submit all of the programming applications in this specialization.  A successful web application provides information t o users that is (1) useful, and also (2)  easy to access and understand.  This information is  often collected from users, as well as  from other information sources, and must be stored  in a manner that allows it to be  manipulated by the web application. The typical app roach is to store this data in a  relational database.  In this module you will learn  some basic concepts associated with  modeling the data in a web application, including h ow to specify the relationships between  various data entities.  We will also investigate ho w to hook a web application up to a back- end data store, along with good design techniques t hat will make it easier to use the data in  your web applications by maintaining consistency th roughout the entire web stack. Middleware is an abstraction layer that hides details about hardware devices and other lower-level software services from an application.  Middleware services implement common low-level functions, such as communication with the operating system, application servers, database servers, etc., so that application developers do not need to concern themselves with these details, and can instead focus on the application functionality they are trying to provide.  In a web application, these services generally make use of the HTTP protocol, and in a web application framework, the MVC design pattern can be thought of as being implemented over the middleware. In our final module we will discuss the User Interface. We will touch on CSS and JavaScript, and how these are used to add style to layout and design of HTML documents. We will also learn about Ajax and how it improves user requests.   ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:40h:1|2;Web Development

Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Part II focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms. All the features of this course are available for free.

It is one of the eight universities of the Ivy League, and one of the nine Colonial Colleges founded before the American Revolution. Welcome to Algorithms, Part II. We define an undirected graph API and consider the adjacency-matrix and adjacency-lists representations. We introduce two classic algorithms for searching a graph—depth-first search and breadth-first search. We also consider the problem of computing connected components and conclude with related problems and applications. In this lecture we study directed graphs. We begin with depth-first search and breadth-first search in digraphs and describe applications ranging from garbage collection to web crawling. Next, we introduce a depth-first search based algorithm for computing the topological order of an acyclic digraph. Finally, we implement the Kosaraju−Sharir algorithm for computing the strong components of a digraph. In this lecture we study the minimum spanning tree problem. We begin by considering a generic greedy algorithm for the problem. Next, we consider and implement two classic algorithm for the problem—Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm. We conclude with some applications and open problems. In this lecture we study shortest-paths problems. We begin by analyzing some basic properties of shortest paths and a generic algorithm for the problem. We introduce and analyze Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest-paths problems with nonnegative weights. Next, we consider an even faster algorithm for DAGs, which works even if the weights are negative. We conclude with the Bellman−Ford−Moore algorithm for edge-weighted digraphs with no negative cycles. We also consider applications ranging from content-aware fill to arbitrage. In this lecture we introduce the maximum flow and minimum cut problems. We begin with the Ford−Fulkerson algorithm. To analyze its correctness, we establish the maxflow−mincut theorem. Next, we consider an efficient implementation of the Ford−Fulkerson algorithm, using the shortest augmenting path rule. Finally, we consider applications, including bipartite matching and baseball elimination. In this lecture we consider specialized sorting algorithms for strings and related objects. We begin with a subroutine to sort integers in a small range. We then consider two classic radix sorting algorithms—LSD and MSD radix sorts. Next, we consider an especially efficient variant, which is a hybrid of MSD radix sort and quicksort known as 3-way radix quicksort. We conclude with suffix sorting and related applications. In this lecture we consider specialized algorithms for symbol tables with string keys. Our goal is a data structure that is as fast as hashing and even more flexible than binary search trees. We begin with multiway tries next we consider ternary search tries. Finally, we consider character-based operations, including prefix match and longest prefix, and related applications. In this lecture we consider algorithms for searching for a substring in a piece of text. We begin with a brute-force algorithm, whose running time is quadratic in the worst case. Next, we consider the ingenious Knuth−Morris−Pratt algorithm whose running time is guaranteed to be linear in the worst case. Then, we introduce the Boyer−Moore algorithm, whose running time is sublinear on typical inputs. Finally, we consider the Rabin−Karp fingerprint algorithm, which uses hashing in a clever way to solve the substring search and related problems. A regular expression is a method for specifying a set of strings. Our topic for this lecture is the famous grep algorithm that determines whether a given text contains any substring from the set. We examine an efficient implementation that makes use of our digraph reachability implementation from Week 1. We study and implement several classic data compression schemes, including run-length coding, Huffman compression, and LZW compression. We develop efficient implementations from first principles using a Java library for manipulating binary data that we developed for this purpose, based on priority queue and symbol table implementations from earlier lectures. Our lectures this week are centered on the idea of problem-solving models like maxflow and shortest path, where a new problem can be formulated as an instance of one of those problems, and then solved with a classic and efficient algorithm. To complete the course, we describe the classic unsolved problem from theoretical computer science that is centered on the concept of algorithm efficiency and guides us in the search for efficient solutions to difficult problems.  The quintessential problem-solving model is known as linear programming, and the simplex method for solving it is one of the most widely used algorithms. In this lecture, we given an overview of this central topic in operations research and describe its relationship to algorithms that we have considered. Is there a universal problem-solving model to which all problems that we would like to solve reduce and for which we know an efficient algorithm? You may be surprised to learn that we do no know the answer to this question. In this lecture we introduce the complexity classes P, NP, and NP-complete, pose the famous P = NP question, and consider implications in the context of algorithms that we have treated in this course. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:14h:1|2;Java

It covers the second half of our book Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach (the first half is covered in our Coursera course Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose, to be released in the fall of 2018). Our intent is to demystify computation and to build awareness about the substantial intellectual underpinnings and rich history of the field of computer science. First, we introduce classic algorithms along with scientific techniques for evaluating performance, in the context of modern applications. Next, we introduce classic theoretical models that allow us to address fundamental questions about computation, such as computability, universality, and intractability. We conclude with machine architecture (including machine-language programming and its relationship to coding in Java) and logic design (including a full CPU design built from the ground up).  The course emphasizes the relationships between applications programming, the theory of computation, real computers, and the field's history and evolution, including the nature of the contributions of Boole, Shannon, Turing, von Neumann, and others.

It is one of the eight universities of the Ivy League, and one of the nine Colonial Colleges founded before the American Revolution. This lesson provides information about the course Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose, which is the precursor to Computer Science: Algorithms, Theory, and Machines. We introduce and study classic algorithms for two fundamental problems, in the context of realistic applications. Our message is that efficient algorithms (binary search and mergesort, in this case) are a key ingredient in addressing computational problems with scalable solutions that can handle huge instances, and that the scientific method is essential in evaluating the effectiveness of such solutions. Our introduction to data structures is a careful look at the fundamental stack and queue abstractions, including performance specifications. Then we introduce the concept of linked structures and focus on their utility in developing simple, safe, clear, and efficient implementations of stacks and queues. The symbol table abstraction is one of the most important and useful programmer's tools, s we illustrate with several examples in this lecture. Extending the scientific approach of the previous two lectures, we introduce and study binary search trees, a classic data structure that supports efficient implementations of this abstraction. The theory of computing helps us address fundamental questions about the nature of computation while at the same time helping us better understand the ways in which we interact with the computer. In this lecture, we introduce formal languages and abstract machines, focusing on simple models that are actually widely useful in practical applications. In 1936, Alan Turing published a paper that is widely hailed as one of the most important scientific papers of the 20th century. This lecture is devoted to the two far-reaching central ideas of the paper: All computational devices have equivalent computational power, and there are limitations to that power. As computer applications expanded, computer scientists and mathematicians realized that a refinement of Turing's ideas is needed. Which computational problems can we solve with the resource limitations that are inescapable in the real world? As described in this lecture, this question, fundamentally, remains unanswered. Every programmer needs understand the basic characteristics of the underlying computer processor being used. Fortunately, the fundamental design of computer processors has changed little since the 1960s. In this lecture, we provide insights into how your Java code actually gets its job done by introducing an imaginary computer that is similar to both the minicomputers of the 1960s and the microprocessor chips found in today's laptops and mobile devices. Continuing our description of processor design and low-level programming, we provide context stretching back to the 1950s and discuss future implications of the von Neumann machine, where programs and data are kept in the same memory. We examine in detail the idea that we design new computers by simulating them on old ones, something that Turing's theory guarantees will always be effective. Starting with a few simple abstractions (wires that can carry on/off values and switches that can control the values carried by wires), we address in this lecture the design of the circuits that implement computer processors. We consider gates that implement simple logical functions and components for higher-level functions, such as addition. The lecture culminates with a full circuit for an arithmetic/logic unit. In this lecture, we provide the last part of our answer to the question How does a computer work? by developing a complete circuit for a computer processor, where every switch and wire is visible. While vastly different in scale, this circuit, from a design point of view, has many of the same characteristics as the circuits found in your computer and your phone. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:43h:1|2;Algorithms

Welcome to week 1! In lesson one, you will learn to recognize the six categories of engineering materials through examples from everyday life, and we’ll discuss how the structure of those materials leads to their properties. Lesson two explores how point defects explain solid state diffusion. We will illustrate crystallography – the atomic-scale arrangement of atoms that we can see with the electron microscope. We will also describe the Arrhenius Relationship, and apply it to the number of vacancies in a crystal. We’ll finish by discussing how point defects facilitate solid state diffusion, and applying the Arrhenius Relationship to solid state diffusion. Welcome to week 2! In lesson three we will discover how dislocations at the atomic-level structure of materials explain plastic (permanent) deformation. You will learn to define a linear defect and see how materials deform through dislocation motion. Lesson four compares stress versus strain, and introduces the “Big Four” mechanical properties of elasticity, yield strength, tensile strength, and ductility. You’ll assess what happens beyond the tensile strength of an object. And you’ll learn about a fifth important property – toughness. Welcome to week 3! In lesson five we’ll explore creep deformation and learn to analyze a creep curve.  We’ll apply the Arrhenius Relationship to creep deformation and identify the mechanisms of creep deformation. In lesson six we find that the phenomenon of ductile-to-brittle transition is related to a particular crystal structure (the body-centered cubic). We’ll also learn to plot the ductile-to-brittle transition for further analysis. Welcome to week 4! In lesson seven we will examine the concept of critical flaws. We’ll define fracture toughness and critical flaw size with the design plot. We’ll also distinguish how we break things in good and bad ways. Lesson eight explores the concept of fatigue in engineering materials. We’ll define fatigue and examine the fatigue curve and fatigue strength. We’ll also identify mechanisms of fatigue. Welcome to week 5! In lesson nine we’ll deal with how to make things fast and slow. We’ll examine the lead-tin phase diagram and look at its practical applications as an example of making something slowly. Then we’ll evaluate the TTT diagram for eutectoid steel, and compare diffusional to diffusionless transformations with the TTT diagram, monitoring how we make things rapidly. Lesson ten is a brief history of semiconductors. Here, we discuss the role of semiconductor materials in the modern electronics industry. Our friend Arrhenius is back again, and this time we’re applying the Arrhenius Relationship to both intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors. We’ll also look at combined intrinsic and extrinsic behavior. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:40h:1|2;Java

From this point forward we will stop using the browser-based Python grading environment because the browser-based Python environment (Skulpt) is not capable of running the more complex programs we will be developing in this class. Regular expressions are a very specialized language that allow us to succinctly search strings and extract data from strings.   Regular expressions are a language unto themselves.  It is not essential to know how to use regular expressions, but they can be quite useful and powerful. In this section we learn about the protocols that web browsers use to retrieve documents and web applications use to interact with Application Program Interfaces (APIs). In this section we learn to use Python to retrieve data from web sites and APIs over the Internet. In this section, we learn how to retrieve and parse XML (eXtensible Markup Language) data. In this module, we work with Application Program Interfaces / Web Services using the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data format. This Specialization builds on the success of the Python for Everybody course and will introduce fundamental programming concepts including data structures, networked application program interfaces, and databases, using the Python programming language. In the Capstone Project, you’ll use the technologies learned throughout the Specialization to design and create your own applications for data retrieval, processing, and visualization. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:31h:1|2;Web Development

Learning how to design and articulate meaning using color, type, and imagery is essential to making interfaces function clearly and seamlessly. Through a series of lectures and visual exercises, you will focus on the many individual elements and components that make up the skillset of an interface designer. By the end of this course, you will be able to describe the key formal elements of clear, consistent, and intuitive UI design, and apply your learned skills to the design of a static screen-based interface. This is the first course in the UI/UX Design Specialization, which brings a design-centric approach to user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design, and offers practical, skill-based instruction centered around a visual communications perspective, rather than on one focused on marketing or programming alone.  These courses are ideal for anyone with some experience in graphic or visual design and who would like to build their skill set in UI or UX for app and web design. It would also be ideal for anyone with experience in front- or back-end web development or human-computer interaction and want to sharpen their visual design and analysis skills for UI or UX.

Offering rigorous undergraduate and graduate degree programs through six schools—Art, Critical Studies, Dance, Film/Video, Music, and Theater—CalArts has championed creative excellence, critical reflection, and the development of new forms and expressions. Welcome! In this first module I will summarize the assignments and expectations of this course, as well as the UI/UX Design Specialization.  In this first week we will look at some basic broad concepts and contexts for user interfaces, looking at examples both on and off-screen. We will look at basic principles of interaction theory, discuss the relationship between UI and UX, and examine the relationship between coding and designing. We will discuss the roles of functionality and aesthetics in interface design and outline a form-first philosophy to user interface design. This week will focus on background information and terminology and will give you the context and vocabulary necessary before you start making great interfaces! This week we are going to examine the various formal elements that make up an interface. We’ll start out with the larger questions of content, context and audience that frame any UI/UX project. In other words: What is it? Who is it for? And, where does it live? And we’ll look at the big picture of overall design direction, what is often referred to as “look and feel”. From there we’ll go into detail of how the basic components of how visual design works in the context of interface design: language, shape, color, imagery, typography, and icons. These areas will be the formal building blocks you will use to create the more complex visual structure of a screen-based user interface.  This week we are going to take our static interface elements and begin to think about how a user interacts with them. In other words, how to bring these elements a stage closer to having a life on the screen. We’ll be looking at navigational conventions, such as menus, buttons, and icons in different states. Our focus will move from what the graphic interface looks like, to include how it works and how it responds to the user. By adding interactivity to our static designs, the idea is to think more deeply about the role the designer plays in shaping a user’s interactive experience. This week we are going to take our individual interface components and see what happens when we try to put them together into a more complex structure. We’ll be looking at how to get our components to work harmoniously as a family, figuring out how hierarchy works in the interface, and discussing conventions and expectations of contemporary interface design. We’ll also be examining how to navigate to different screens and how to build visual relationships between different kinds of content within a single site. Finally, we’ll be discussing different platforms, how to create variable content for different screen sizes, and looking at how to organize complex bodies of content into user-friendly structures. The UI/UX Design Specialization brings a design-centric approach to user interface and user experience design, and offers practical, skill-based instruction centered around a visual communications perspective, rather than on one focused on marketing or programming alone. In this sequence of four courses, you will summarize and demonstrate all stages of the UI/UX development process, from user research to defining a project’s strategy, scope, and information architecture, to developing sitemaps and wireframes. You’ll learn current best practices and conventions in UX design and apply them to create effective and compelling screen-based experiences for websites or apps. User interface and user experience design is a high-demand field, but the skills and knowledge you will learn in this Specialization are applicable to a wide variety of careers, from marketing to web design to human-computer interaction.

Apple’ trademarked brand was valued at over $100 billion as of 2017. J.K. Rowling’s Harry potter franchise has generated over $25 billion to date. But how did the law come to create such enormous value in intangible assets? This course will introduce the various types of U.S. intellectual property: patents, which cover inventions and process innovations copyright, which protects original works of authorship and trademarks, which protect a business’ commercial identity as the source of valuable goods and services. You will then explore case studies of how global businesses have used intellectual property law to generate enormous value from these intangible assets. Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), German, Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), German, Russian, English, Spanish The University of Pennsylvania (commonly referred to as Penn) is a private university, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. A member of the Ivy League, Penn is the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, and considers itself to be the first university in the United States with both undergraduate and graduate studies.  This module will introduce the concept of intellectual property and explain how it creates value. You will learn about the major forms of intellectual property protection in the United States - copyright, trademarks, and patents, as well as alternative forms of intellectual property protection. Why have intellectual property protection at all? This module examines the effect of intellectual property law on the modern economy, and the policy reasons behind providing intellectual property protection. Intellectual property law is ever-evolving as society's needs change. This module examines alternative forms of intellectual property protection, and explores the benefits and drawbacks of those alternatives. This module takes an in-depth look at the intellectual property strategies of three major companies across three very different industries: Apple, General Motors, and Novartis.  Intellectual property is the currency of the tech world. The pharmaceutical patent for Lipitor generated over $100 billion in revenue, the copyright for the Harry Potter franchise has generated over $25 billion to date, and the trademarked brands of the world’s largest tech companies now eclipse $100 billion in value. But what makes these intangible assets so valuable? Through the courses in this specialization, you will learn the differences between the various forms of U.S. intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, and trademarks, and their various applications to human innovations. Drawing from that knowledge, you will then work to develop a trademark strategy for a company, analyze a patent document, and address a copyright cease-and-desist request. After completing these hands-on projects, you will have the necessary framework to craft integrated intellectual property strategies tailored to an organization’s core business goals. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:4h:1|2;Java

We will learn a lot of theory: how to sort data and how it helps for searching how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively when it makes sense to proceed greedily how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies. You will practice solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently (so that they run in less than a second).

Learn more on www.hse.ru Welcome to the first module of Data Structures and Algorithms! Here we will provide an overview of where algorithms and data structures are used (hint: everywhere) and walk you through a few sample programming challenges. The programming challenges represent an important (and often the most difficult!) part of this specialization because the only way to fully understand an algorithm is to implement it. Writing correct and efficient programs is hard please don’t be surprised if they don’t work as you planned—our first programs did not work either! We will help you on your journey through the specialization by showing how to implement your first programming challenges. We will also introduce testing techniques that will help increase your chances of passing assignments on your first attempt. In case your program does not work as intended, we will show how to fix it, even if you don’t yet know which test your implementation is failing on. In this module you will learn that programs based on efficient algorithms can solve the same problem billions of times faster than programs based on naïve algorithms. You will learn how to estimate the running time and memory of an algorithm without even implementing it. Armed with this knowledge, you will be able to compare various algorithms, select the most efficient ones, and finally implement them as our programming challenges! In this module you will learn about seemingly naïve yet powerful class of algorithms called greedy algorithms. After you will learn the key idea behind the greedy algorithms, you may feel that they represent the algorithmic Swiss army knife that can be applied to solve nearly all programming challenges in this course. But be warned: with a few exceptions that we will cover, this intuitive idea rarely works in practice! For this reason, it is important to prove that a greedy algorithm always produces an optimal solution before using this algorithm. In the end of this module, we will test your intuition and taste for greedy algorithms by offering several programming challenges. In this module you will learn about a powerful algorithmic technique called Divide and Conquer. Based on this technique, you will see how to search huge databases millions of times faster than using naïve linear search. You will even learn that the standard way to multiply numbers (that you learned in the grade school) is far from the being the fastest! We will then apply the divide-and-conquer technique to design two efficient algorithms (merge sort and quick sort) for sorting huge lists, a problem that finds many applications in practice. Finally, we will show that these two algorithms are optimal, that is, no algorithm can sort faster! In this final module of the course you will learn about the powerful algorithmic technique for solving many optimization problems called Dynamic Programming. It turned out that dynamic programming can solve many problems that evade all attempts to solve them using greedy or divide-and-conquer strategy. There are countless applications of dynamic programming in practice: from maximizing the advertisement revenue of a TV station, to search for similar Internet pages, to gene finding (the problem where biologists need to find the minimum number of mutations to transform one gene into another). You will learn how the same idea helps to automatically make spelling corrections and to show the differences between two versions of the same text.  In this module, we continue practicing implementing dynamic programming solutions. Computer science legend Donald Knuth once said “I don’t understand things unless I try to program them.” We also believe that the best way to learn an algorithm is to program it. However, many excellent books and online courses on algorithms, that excel in introducing algorithmic ideas, have not yet succeeded in teaching you how to implement algorithms, the crucial computer science skill that you have to master at your next job interview. We tried to fill this gap by forming a diverse team of instructors that includes world-leading experts in theoretical and applied algorithms at UCSD (Daniel Kane, Alexander Kulikov, and Pavel Pevzner), a chief data scientist at Yandex (Michael Levin), and a former software engineer at Google (Neil Rhodes). This unique combination of skills makes this Specialization different from other excellent MOOCs on algorithms that are all developed by theoretical computer scientists. While these MOOCs focus on theory, our Specialization is a mix of algorithmic theory/practice/applications with software engineering. You will learn algorithms by implementing nearly 100 coding problems in a programming language of your choice. To the best of knowledge, no other online course in Algorithms comes close to offering you a wealth of programming challenges (and puzzles!) that you may face at your next job interview. We invested over 3000 hours into designing our challenges as an alternative to multiple choice questions that you usually find in MOOCs. ;10;1;1;Długość kursu:21h:1|2;DevOps

You will discover how to create modular, flexible, and reusable software, by applying object-oriented design principles and guidelines. And, you will be able to communicate these designs in a visual notation known as Unified Modelling Language (UML). You will be challenged in the Capstone Project to apply your knowledge of object-oriented design by evolving and documenting the Java codebase for an Android application with corresponding UML documentation.  After completing this course, you will be able to:  • Apply the Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) technique to analyze and design the object-oriented model for a problem.  • Explain and apply object-oriented modeling principles and their purpose (e.g., abstraction, encapsulation, decomposition, generalization). • Explain and apply different types of inheritance • Explain the difference between association, aggregation, and composition dependencies. • Express object-oriented models as Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams. • Translate between UML class diagrams and equivalent Java code. • Apply design guidelines for modularity, separation of concerns, information hiding, and conceptual integrity to create a flexible, reusable, maintainable design. • Explain the tradeoff between cohesion and coupling.

As one of Canada’s top universities, we’re known for excellence across the humanities, sciences, creative arts, business, engineering and health sciences. Good software design begins before coding. After establishing the initial software requirements, design practices involve two main activities: conceptual design and technical design. In this module, you will realize the importance of design and object-oriented thinking, and learn how to design software using techniques like CRC cards. Best software design practices have evolved alongside programming languages. Today, all developers should be familiar with abstraction, encapsulation, decomposition, and generalization, which are fundamental principles in object-oriented design. You will learn all of these principles and how they are expressed in Java and communicated visually in Unified Modelling Language. Additional design principles will help you to create code that is flexible, reusable, and maintainable. In this module you will learn about coupling and cohesion, separation of concerns, information hiding, and conceptual integrity. You will also learn to avoid common pitfalls with inheritance, and ways to express software behavior in UML. In the previous modules you were introduced to object-oriented analysis and design, object-oriented modeling, and design principles. To cement your understanding of this material, you created a UML class diagram from an example Android code base, and used your understanding of the code base to make sequence and state diagrams to model its behavior. Now, in the final module of the course, given a description of new functionality and an updated UML class diagram, you will implement the updated design into the Android code base. After completing this development task, you will be ready to complete the final exam. In the Software Design and Architecture Specialization, you will learn how to apply design principles, patterns, and architectures to create reusable and flexible software applications and systems.

Tech progress is an important source of economic growth and raises broader questions about the human condition, including how culture evolves and who controls that evolution. Technology also matters in countless other ways as it often establishes the framework in which governments interact with their citizens, both in allowing speech and blocking it and in establishing exactly what the boundaries are between private life and the government.  And technology itself is powerfully shaped by the laws that apply in areas as diverse as copyright, antitrust, patents, privacy, speech law and the regulation of networks. The course will explore seven topics:   1.      Microsoft: The Desktop vs. The Internet. We will start with a look at the technology path that led to the first personal computer in early 1975, the Altair 8800. That path starts with the vacuum tube, moves to transistors, then to integrated circuits and finally to the microprocessor. We will look at the early days of software on the personal computer and the competition between selling software and open-source approaches as well as the problem of software piracy. We will discus the public good nature of software. The 1981 launch of the IBM PC revolutionized the personal computer market and started the path to Microsoft's powerful position and eventual monopoly in that market with the selection of MS-DOS. We then turn to four antitrust cases against Microsoft: (1) the 1994 U.S. case relating to MS-DOS licensing practices (2) the U.S. antitrust middleware case over Microsoft’s response to Netscape Navigator (3) the European Union case regarding Windows Media Player and (4) the EU browser case over Internet Explorer. These disputes arose at the point of maximal competition between the free-standing personal computer and the Internet world that would come after it and we may know enough now to assess how these cases influenced that competition.   2.      Google Emerges (and the World Responds). Google has emerged as one of the dominant platforms of the Internet era and that has led to corresponding scrutiny by regulators throughout the world. Decisions that Google makes about its algorithm can be life altering. Individuals are finding it more difficult to put away past mistakes, as Google never forgets, and businesses can find that their sales plummet if Google moves them from the first page of search results to a later page. With great power comes scrutiny and we will look at how government regulators have evaluated how Google has exercised its power. Both the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the European Union have undertaken substantial investigations of Google’s practices and we will look at both of those.   3.      Smartphones. The Internet started on the desktop but the Internet is increasingly mobile and people are seemingly tethered to their smartphones and tablets. And we have seen an interesting shift in that market away from Nokia handsets and the Blackberry to Apple's iPhone and its iOS platform and to the Android platform. The legal infrastructure of smartphones and tablets is extraordinarily complex. We will start by looking at U.S. spectrum policy and the effort to free up 500 megahertz of spectrum. We will look at the activities of standard setting organizations, including the IEEE and the creation of the 802.11 standard and Wi-Fi (or, if you prefer, wifi), the creation of patent pools and the regulation of standard essential patents. We will look at the FTC action against Google/Motorola Mobility and Apple's lawsuit against Samsung over utility and design patents relating to the iPhone. Finally, we will take a brief look at the European Commission's investigation into the Android platform.   4.      Nondiscrimination and Network Neutrality. Facebook has more than 1 billion users and measure that against a world population of roughly 7 billion and a total number of Internet users of roughly 2.5 billion. A course on law and technology simply has to grapple with the basic framework for regulating the Internet and a key idea there is the notion of network neutrality. Nondiscrimination obligations are frequent in regulated network industries, but at the same, discrimination can be an important tool of design for communication networks. We will start our look at the Internet by looking at the great first communications network of the United States, the post office and will look in particular at the Post Office Act of 1845.   We will then move to modern times and will consider efforts by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to produce sensible and sustainable nondiscrimination conditions for the Internet and will touch briefly on comparisons from around the world.   5.      The Day the Music Died? In many ways, the Internet came first to music with the rise of peer-to-peer (p2p) music sharing through Napster and its successors. We start with a look into music platform history and the devices that brought recorded music into the home: the phonograph and the player piano. We turn to radio and the legal regime that puts music on the airwaves, the performing rights organizations like ASCAP and BMI. We look at the antitrust issues associated with the blanket license. We consider a failed music platform, digital audio tape, and the complicated legal regime associated with it, the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992. We will consider the copyright issues raised by the creation and distribution of music and the litigation over the p2p technologies such as Napster and Grokster. The music industry responded to p2p technology by adding digital rights management tools to CDs. As music distribution switched from physical media to digital distribution, we entered the world of Apple and the iPod and iTunes. We consider the DRM issues associated with Apple's music platform as seen by Steve Jobs. We conclude by looking at emerging subscription services like Spotify and the service that Apple is building based on its purchase of Beats.   6.      Video: Listening and Watching. Images are some of the most powerful ways in which ideas and speech are communicated and video has long been regulated by the state. That starts as a communications law issue with government regulation of the radio spectrum, but also leads to the design of the television system with the assignment of channels and eventually the definition of digital television. And with the emergence first of cable TV and subsequently the VCR critical copyright roadblocks had to be overcome for new distribution technologies to emerge. We will consider the legal engineering that led to the DVD platform, which was an exercise in patent pools and trademark creation. We will sort through the creation of the digital TV platform and will also look at the copyright underpinnings for Netflix. And we will consider the question of technology neutrality in the content of the copyright fight over a new video distribution entrant, Aereo. Finally, we close the week with a brief look at the incentive spectrum auctions and the possible end of broadcast television.   7.      The Mediated Book. Gutenberg revolutionized books with his printing press and for academics, books are sacred objects. But the printed book is on the run and with the rise of the ebook, we are entering a new era, the era of the mediated book. This is more than just a change in technology. We will look at the issues created by the rise of the ebook, issues about control over content and licensing and of the privacy of thought itself. We will also look at the legal skirmishes over this space, including the copyright fair use litigation over Google Books, the Apple e-book antitrust case. And we will look at the Amazon Kindle platform.

THIS VERSION OF THIS COURSE WAS LAUNCHED IN JULY 2015 AND HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE THEN. MUCH HAS HAPPENED SINCE THEN SO YOU SHOULD CONSIDER ANOTHER COURSE FOR MORE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS. ************************************************************** This is a course on the law and economics of media platforms. Media delivery is frequently organized around a set of tools that bring together different parties to interact. Edison’s phonograph and wax cylinders did that, bringing together music producers and consumers wanting to listen to music at home, but so does Microsoft Windows, which sits between software developers and computer users. In this module, we will focus on Microsoft and its arc from start up to dominance and repeated antitrust target. We will look at the technology leading to the personal computer and the release of the IBM PC in August, 1981 and then the rise of Microsoft from there. We will turn to antitrust actions against Microsoft, first in the United States in 1994 for its MS-DOS licensing practices and then again in the United States in 1998 for its response to the Internet and Netscape Navigator. We will then turn to two competition policy actions against Microsoft in Europe. In this module, we will focus on Google and its arc from 1998 start up to dominance and repeated antitrust target. We will look at the underlying tech, two-sided markets and auctions and then at antitrust investigations in the U.S. and the EU. In this module, we will focus on the emergence of the smartphones platform. That is an interesting mix of government policy (especially regarding spectrum), collective private activity (standard setting, such as that for the 802.11 standard and for Wi-Fi), and individual private actions (such as that leading to the Apple iPhone and the Android platform). In this module, we will focus on the issue of network neutrality, or, as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission likes to put it, the open Internet. In this module, we will focus on different platforms for distributing music. That will start with the great home technology of the early 1900s—the phonograph and the player piano—before turning to radio and the ASCAP and BMI licensing regime for public performances. We then will turn to a failed technology and legal regime, digital audio tape and the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992. We will then switch to MP3 players, from the relatively obscure (the Diamond Rio) to the ubiquitous (the iPod) and to Apple’s digital rights management regime. We will then switch to the issues raised by peer-to-peer software like Napster and Grokster and then close with an examination of the switch from physical distribution media to digital and subscriptions like Spotify. In this module, we will focus on the different platforms for delivering video to the home. We will start with the history of TV in the U.S. in the 1940s and then jump to the copyright issues associated with the creation of cable TV in the 1960s and 1970s. We will then switch to considering two devices (the VCR and the DVD player), two services (Netflix and Aereo) and then creation of digital TV. In this module, we will focus on the emergence of digital books and digital libraries. Three topics loom large: (1) Google’s efforts to copy millions of books and bring them online through Google Books (2) Amazon’s creation of the Kindle ebook platform and (3) Apple’s launch of the iPad with its associated bookstore and the resulting antitrust lawsuit over that launch. We review the entire course in this last module. Done with the course? Wondering what comes next? Me, too, but this is where the experimental module comes in. A module to test other ways to interact and to explore ideas that might appear in future versions of the course.

Why use CSharp and Unity instead of some other language and game engine? Well, CSharp is a really good language for learning how to program and then programming professionally. Also, the Unity game engine is very popular with indie game developers Unity games were downloaded 16,000,000,000 times in 2016! Finally, CSharp is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity environment. This course doesn't assume you have any previous programming experience. Don't worry if you've never written code before we'll start at the very beginning and work our way up to building small games by the end of the course. Throughout the course you'll learn core programming concepts that apply to lots of programming languages, including CSharp, and you'll also learn how to apply those concepts when you develop games.  Computer programming is really fun in general, and programming games is even better!  Caution: Beginning (assuming no prior programming knowledge) is not the same as easy (not hard to do). Learning to program IS hard to do, especially since this course is essentially the first half of a freshman-level college course. Meeting the course challenges while you master the material will be rewarding to you, but doing that will require hard work and maybe even a few expletives along the way.

Why some materials conduct heat or electricity while others are insulators?  Why adding just a small amount of carbon to iron results in an alloy that is so much stronger than the base metal?  In this course, you will learn how a material’s properties are determined by the microstructure of the material, which is in turn determined by composition and the processing that the material has undergone. This is the first of three Coursera courses that mirror the Introduction to Materials Science class that is taken by most engineering undergrads at Georgia Tech.  The aim of the course is to help students better understand the engineering materials that are used in the world around them.  This first section covers the fundamentals of materials science including atomic structure and bonding, crystal structure, atomic and microscopic defects, and noncrystalline materials such as glasses, rubbers, and polymers. Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish The Georgia Institute of Technology is one of the nation's top research universities, distinguished by its commitment to improving the human condition through advanced science and technology. Georgia Tech's campus occupies 400 acres in the heart of the city of Atlanta, where more than 20,000 undergraduate and graduate students receive a focused, technologically based education. This module will introduce the core principles of materials science.  Topics that will be covered include the different general material types (metal, ceramic, polymer, etc.) and the properties associated with each type, some methods that are used to experimentally determine and quantify a material's properties, and how a materials engineer might go about choosing a suitable material for a simple application.  This module also introduces the concept of the microstructure-processing-properties relationship which is at the heart of all materials science.  In this module, we will discuss the structure of the atom, how atoms interact with each other, and how those interactions affect material properties.  We will explore how the types of atoms present in a material determine what kind of bonding occurs, what differentiates the three types of primary bonds - metallic, ionic, and covalent, and the implications of the type of bonding on the material microstructure.  You will learn how atoms arrange themselves as a natural result of their size and bonding.  This knowledge will provide you with a foundation for understanding the relationship between a material's microstructure and its properties.  This module covers how atoms are arranged in crystalline materials.  Many of the materials that we deal with on a daily basis are crystalline, meaning that they are made up of a regularly repeating array of atoms.  The building block of a crystal, which is called the Bravais lattice, dtermines some of the physical properties of a material.  An understanding of these crystallographic principles will be vital to discussions of defects and diffusion, which are covered in the next module.  In the previous module, we learned how the lattice structure of a crystalline material in part determines the properties of that material.  In this module, we will begin to learn how defects - deviations from the expected microstructure - also have a large effect on properties.  This module covers one-dimensional, or point, defects which can be missing atoms (vacancies) or excess atoms (interstitial solution) or the wrong type of atom at a lattice point (substitutional solution).  Building on these concepts, part of this module will cover diffusion - the movement of atoms through the crystal structure.  This module covers two- and three-dimensional defects such as dislocations, grain boundaries, and precipitates.  The discussion extends to explain how deformation of a material is accommodated at the microscopic level.  We will finish by addressing how the presence and properties of defects can increase or decrease the strength of a material. In this module, we discuss materials that are not fully crystalline, such as polymers, rubbers, and glasses.  You will learn how the absence of crystallinity affects the behavior of these materials and what factors affect their formation and properties.  Lessons include discussions of the microstructure and defects in amorphous materials, partial cystallinity in polymers, and demonstrations of materials exhibiting ductile and brittle behavior at different temperatures.  ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:4h:1|2;Java

Along the way we will also discuss: - Responsive web design and mobile web challenges  - Mobile-first approach  - Web typography  - The relationship between design and programming and whether it is important to know how to code  - The different web technologies that make the web work, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, server-side coding, and databases.  This course is the continuation of the course Web Design: Strategy and Information Architecture, in which students completed the first half of a large scale project—developing a comprehensive plan for a complex website. If you are intending to complete the assignments in this course to earn a certificate you must complete the Strategy and Information Architecture course first so you have the materials and data needed to begin creating wireframes and mockups in this course.  This is the fourth and last course in the UI/UX Design Specialization, which brings a design-centric approach to user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design, and offers practical, skill-based instruction centered around a visual communications perspective, rather than on one focused on marketing or programming alone.  These courses are ideal for anyone with some experience in graphic or visual design and who would like to build their skill set in UI or UX for app and web design. It would also be ideal for anyone with experience in front- or back-end web development or human-computer interaction and want to sharpen their visual design and analysis skills for UI or UX.

Offering rigorous undergraduate and graduate degree programs through six schools—Art, Critical Studies, Dance, Film/Video, Music, and Theater—CalArts has championed creative excellence, critical reflection, and the development of new forms and expressions. This week is all about wireframes. After mapping out our strategy and scope in the previous course, Web Design: Strategy and Information Architecture, this is the first time in the process that we will address the screen. Now things are going to get much more concrete as we’re starting to actually lay out elements for the user interface. This week you will learn why working on wireframes first—before designing high-fidelity mockups—is a helpful intermediate step. I’ll also talk about responsive design, navigation systems, wayfinding, common design patterns, and strategies for homepage design. And, we’ll discuss which tools are most appropriate for creating wireframes. Because creating those will be your assignment at the end of the week.  We finally reached the point that many of you—especially if you consider yourself a visual designer—have probably been waiting for. We’ll now talk about designing the look and feel for your website. Meaning, we’re ready to design visual mockups. Finally, you’ll get to decide on colors, typefaces, and images. Maybe you’ll create a few illustrations. And your site will need a logo, too. This week, we’ll focus on designing the visual mockups of just the homepage. To find some inspiration, I’ll also have you create a mood board. This week, you’ll continue the visual design of your websites, refining the look and feel based on peer feedback. Having worked on the homepage mockup last week, it’s time to design the remaining screens. As an important aside, I will take you on a short expedition to the land of code. Although this specialization isn’t about learning how to code, I want to at least introduce you to the technologies that make the web work. And we’ll look at a few coding examples. After all, the web is built upon certain languages—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  in order to be an effective UX designer, it is helpful to have a rudimentary understanding of these technologies.  Welcome to the final week of this course and the final week of the entire UI/UX Design Specialization. I hope that you learned a lot of new concepts, techniques, and skills that will allow you to design some amazing interactive experiences in the real world. This week, you will have time to revise any of your project components. And then I’d like you to assemble them into a presentation that will represent the culmination of all of the UX phases we covered. This should be a great project to include in your portfolio. I’ll also show you how to take your static mockups and assemble them into clickable prototypes.   The UI/UX Design Specialization brings a design-centric approach to user interface and user experience design, and offers practical, skill-based instruction centered around a visual communications perspective, rather than on one focused on marketing or programming alone. In this sequence of four courses, you will summarize and demonstrate all stages of the UI/UX development process, from user research to defining a project’s strategy, scope, and information architecture, to developing sitemaps and wireframes. You’ll learn current best practices and conventions in UX design and apply them to create effective and compelling screen-based experiences for websites or apps. User interface and user experience design is a high-demand field, but the skills and knowledge you will learn in this Specialization are applicable to a wide variety of careers, from marketing to web design to human-computer interaction.

Imaging has a long history, spanning several centuries. But the advances made in the last three decades have revolutionized the camera and dramatically improved the robustness and accuracy of computer vision systems. We describe the fundamentals of imaging, as well as recent innovations in imaging that have had a profound impact on computer vision. This course starts with examining how an image is formed using a lens camera. We explore the optical characteristics of a camera such as its magnification, F-number, depth of field and field of view. Next, we describe how solid-state image sensors (CCD and CMOS) record images, and the key properties of an image sensor such as its resolution, noise characteristics and dynamic range. We describe how image sensors can be used to sense color as well as capture images with high dynamic range. In certain structured environments, an image can be thresholded to produce a binary image from which various geometric properties of objects can be computed and used for recognizing and locating objects. Finally, we present the fundamentals of image processing – the development of computational tools to process a captured image to make it cleaner (denoising, deblurring, etc.) and easier for computer vision systems to analyze (linear and non-linear image filtering methods).

Many of the data structures and algorithms that work with introductory toy examples break when applications process real, large data sets.  Efficiency is critical, but how do we achieve it, and how do we even measure it? This is an intermediate Java course. We recommend this course to learners who have previous experience in software development or a background in computer science, and in particular, we recommend that you have taken the first course in this specialization (which also requires some previous experience with Java).    In this course, you will use and analyze data structures that are used in industry-level applications, such as linked lists, trees, and hashtables.  You will explain how these data structures make programs more efficient and flexible.  You will apply asymptotic Big-O analysis to describe the performance of algorithms and evaluate which strategy to use for efficient data retrieval, addition of new data, deletion of elements, and/or memory usage.  The program you will build throughout this course allows its user to manage, manipulate and reason about large sets of textual data.  This is an intermediate Java course, and we will build on your prior knowledge.  This course is designed around  the same video series as in our first course in this specialization, including explanations of core content, learner videos, student and engineer testimonials, and support videos -- to better allow you to choose your own path through the course!

Innovation is central to who we are and what we do. Here, students learn that knowledge isn't just acquired in the classroom—life is their laboratory. Welcome to the first module in the second course of our Intermediate Java Programming Specialization.  We'll start with introductions again: to ourselves, the Google engineers, and the structure of the course.  After the introduction we'll have a short warm up to get you comfortable with the code you will be building on to this class.  But don't worry--no graded programming assignments yet.  This week is all about getting comfortable and excited to learn. This week we're going to dive into the course programming project.  In the first lesson you'll learn about Strings and Regular Expressions, and in the programming assignment this week you'll apply that knowledge to adding functionality to your text editor so that it can measure the readability of text by calculating something called the Flesch Readability Score.  This course is focused on building code that not only does interesting things, but also finishes them quickly.  So, let's get started building some code! Welcome to week 3!  The text-editor application you worked with last week does something, but it doesn't do it particularly fast.  This week we'll start talking about efficiency.  We'll introduce the concept of Big-O notation, which sounds a little silly, but is really a powerful (and extremely common) way of analyzing a program's efficiency, independent of the system that it's running on and the exact details of how it's implemented.  Then we'll go the other direction and dive into the details, talking about how to measure the actual running time of a piece of code to get an idea of how it really performs in practice.  This week we'll start talking about some of the basic concepts that one expects to find in a data structures course: the idea of data abstraction, and a data structure called a Linked List.  Even though Linked Lists are not very efficient structures (for the most part), they do hit home the idea of linking pieces of data together in your computer's memory, rather than storing the data in one contiguous region.  This linking idea will be central to many of the more advanced data structures, namely trees and graphs, that are coming up later in this course and in the next course in this specialization.  In this module you'll also learn tools and procedures for unit testing your code, which is a way to make sure that what you've written is correct, and a staple practice of any sophisticated software developer. Welcome to week 4!  We know you've been working hard.  We hope you tried that optional Markov Text Generation programming assignment last week, but if not, no worries.  You can always go back and do it later (spoiler alert: it's pretty amazing that such a simple algorithm can produce such realistic text).  This week there's more fun (and hard work) as we learn about trees.  Trees rely on the same linked structure idea as Linked Lists, only they're MUCH faster (usually...).  In the project this week you'll add auto-complete to your text editor.  Believe us when we say it's so cool when you get it working!  You'll see... and we bet you can't wait for the programming assignment now.  :) You made it to the last week!  Congratulations on getting this far!  In this last week we'll be looking at a fundamental data structure called a Hash Table.  If you thought trees were fast, just wait until you see what Hash Tables can do!   Your last programming assignment will add spelling correction suggestions to your text editor, and there's an optional assignment that builds on the same ideas as the main assignment too, if you have the time and energy.   ;10;1;1;Długość kursu:20h:1|2;Algorithms

We will learn about the concepts of threat modeling and cryptography and you'll be able to start to create threat models, and think critically about the threat models created by other people. We'll learn the basics of applying cryptography, such as encryption and secure hashing. We'll learn how attackers can exploit application vulnerabilities through the improper handling user-controlled data. We'll gain a fundamental understanding of injection problems in web applications, including the three most common types of injection problems: SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and command injection.  We'll also cover application authentication and session management where authentication is a major component of a secure web application and session management is the other side of the same coin, since the authenticated state of user requests need to be properly handled and run as one session. We'll learn about sensitive data exposure issues and how you can help protect your customer's data. We'll cover how to effectively store password-related information, and not to store the actual plaintext passwords. We'll participate in coding assignment that will help you to better understand the mechanisms for effectively storing password-related information.  Along the way, we’ll discuss ways of watching out for and mitigating these issues and be able have some fun and exploit two different vulnerabilities in a web application that was designed to be vulnerable, called WebGoat.

In order to drive home these concepts, you will be able to work on exploiting a SQL injection vulnerability in the WebGoat application. You'll be able to formulate plans to mitigate injection problems in your applications. By the end of this module, you will be able to evaluate a system to determine if it follows the generally prescribed secure methods for authentication and session management in web applications. You'll be able to distinguish the relationship between authentication, session management, and access control. You will also be able to exploit WebGoat's authentication and session management vulnerability. As well as be able to evaluate a system to determine if it performs sufficient security logging such that non-repudiation is enforced. This will help drive the concepts that you will learn in this module. By the end of this module, you will understand how to effectively store password-related information, and NOT to store the actual plaintext passwords. You will also have a hands on coding assignment that will help you to better understand the mechanisms for effectively storing password-related information. Ready? This Specialization is intended for software developers of any level who are not yet fluent with secure coding and programming techniques.Through four courses, you will cover the principles of secure coding, concepts of threat modeling and cryptography and exploit vulnerabilities in both C/C++ and Java languages, which will prepare you to think like a hacker and protect your organizations information. The courses provide ample practice activities including exploiting WebGoat, an OWASP project designed to teach penetration testing. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:5h:1|2;Java

Located at the heart of one of the nation’s most vibrant, diverse metropolitan communities, students on the campuses in Minneapolis and St. Paul benefit from extensive partnerships with world-renowned health centers, international corporations, government agencies, and arts, nonprofit, and public service organizations. This brief module introduces the topic of recommender systems (including placing the technology in historical context) and provides an overview of the structure and coverage of the course and specialization. This module introduces recommender systems  in more depth.  It includes a detailed taxonomy of the types of recommender systems, and also includes tours of two systems heavily dependent on recommender technology:  MovieLens and Amazon.com. There is an introductory assessment in the final lesson to ensure that you understand the core concepts behind recommendations before we start learning how to compute them. In this module, you will learn several techniques for non- and lightly-personalized recommendations, including how to use meaningful summary statistics, how to compute product association recommendations, and how to explore using demographics as a means for light personalization.  There is both an assignment (trying out these techniques in a spreadsheet) and a quiz to test your comprehension.   The next topic in this course is content-based filtering, a technique for personalization based on building a profile of personal interests.  Divided over two weeks, you will learn and practice the basic techniques for content-based filtering and then explore a variety of advanced interfaces and content-based computational techniques being used in recommender systems.   The assessments for content-based filtering include an assignment where you compute three types of profile and prediction using a spreadsheet and a quiz on the topics covered.  The assignment is in three parts -- a written assignment, a video intro, and a quiz where you provide answers from your work to be automatically graded. We close this course with a set of mathematical notation that will be helpful as we move forward into a wider range of recommender systems (in later courses in this specialization).   A Recommender System is a process that seeks to predict user preferences. This Specialization covers all the fundamental techniques in recommender systems, from non-personalized and project-association recommenders through content-based and collaborative filtering techniques, as well as advanced topics like matrix factorization, hybrid machine learning methods for recommender systems, and dimension reduction techniques for the user-product preference space. This Specialization is designed to serve both the data mining expert who would want to implement techniques like collaborative filtering in their job, as well as the data literate marketing professional, who would want to gain more familiarity with these topics.  The courses offer interactive, spreadsheet-based exercises to master different algorithms, along with an honors track where you can go into greater depth using the LensKit open source toolkit.  By the end of this Specialization, you’ll be able to implement as well as evaluate recommender systems. The Capstone Project brings together the course material with a realistic recommender design and analysis project. ;10;1;1;Długość kursu:19h:1|2;Java

As we all know, most of low-power electronics, such as remote sensors, are driven by batteries. However, even when it comes to long-lasting batteries, they face an issue that is a regular replacement. It can turn out to be costly as there are hundreds of sensors in remote locations. Whereas, energy harvesting technologies supply unlimited operating life of low-power equipment and even remove the need to replace batteries where it is costly, unfeasible, or unsafe. The whole sessions cover the concept of energy harvesting technologies, which has gained popularity over the last few years, and thus will be beneficial for those who seeks for understanding principles and their applications.

In particular, we are interested in the 3D reconstruction of a rigid scene from images taken by a stationary camera (same viewpoint). This problem is interesting as we want the multiple images of the scene to capture complementary information despite the fact that the scene is rigid and the camera is fixed. To this end, we explore several ways of capturing images where each image provides additional information about the scene. In order to estimate scene properties (depth, surface orientation, material properties, etc.) we first define several important radiometric concepts, such as, light source intensity, surface illumination, surface brightness, image brightness and surface reflectance. Then, we tackle the challenging problem of shape from shading - recovering the shape of a surface from its shading in a single image. Next, we show that if multiple images of a scene of known reflectance are taken while changing the illumination direction, the surface normal at each scene point can be computed. This method, called photometric stereo, provides a dense surface normal map that can be integrated to obtain surface shape.   Next, we discuss depth from defocus, which uses the limited depth of field of the camera to estimate scene structure. From a small number of images taken by changing the focus setting of the lens, a dense depth of the scene is recovered. Finally, we present a suite of techniques that use active illumination (the projection of light patterns onto the scene) to get precise 3D reconstructions of the scene. These active illumination methods are the workhorse of factory automation. They are used on manufacturing lines to assemble products and inspect their visual quality. They are also extensively used in other domains such as driverless cars, robotics, surveillance, medical imaging and special effects in movies.

The course provides learners with a design thinking mindset and equips them with a fundamental toolbox for creating XR applications using rapid prototyping. It starts with a broad overview of the complete XR design process, discussing different paths to becoming an XR creator, what is generally involved in making XR experiences, and how to best get started. The course then emphasizes design thinking, critiques, and ethics while introducing guidelines and user-centered techniques like design jams. The second half of the course introduces a variety of methods and tools for prototyping both physically and digitally including on the XR devices themselves through immersive authoring. The course has an honors track that guides learners through creating their own storyboard, physical prototype, and digital prototype of an XR experience. You will work on exercises that allow you to practice your design skills and also build XR technologies into your workflow by working with specific templates and new digital tools that allow you to preview physical prototypes on AR/VR devices. Subtitles: English Subtitles: English The mission of the University of Michigan is to serve the people of Michigan and the world through preeminence in creating, communicating, preserving and applying knowledge, art, and academic values, and in developing leaders and citizens who will challenge the present and enrich the future. This module will provide you with an introduction to XR design and development. When I say design, I usually mean user experience design or interaction design. Some designers have quite specific definitions of each of those terms, but I think of them broadly as forms of design focused on the creation of new user interfaces. While I think of many parts of this course as providing the theory and background to XR design, I will focus on the practical aspects of XR creation. I will start by making an analogy to filmmaking to establish key requirements, before going on to talk about the main steps part of a larger process and how to get started with doing XR. As we are just getting started, this first module does not have an honors track component associated with it. The honors track will start in the second module. The second module will introduce you to design thinking and how common methods and techniques can be adapted for XR. This will help us build the right mindset for designing novel and compelling XR experiences. We will talk about building empathy with your users, ethical and responsible design, and best practices and design guidelines. I will also cover how to conduct and formulate design critiques in an effort to learn from existing interfaces. Finally, we will look at design jams as a way of solving design challenges collaboratively. Our first exercise in the honors track associated with this course will be a design critique of a VR or AR expedition as part of Google’s Expeditions XR app. You will be asked to develop one new idea that you will then take forward as you start prototyping your design concept next week. We are moving from the conceptual to the practical, from thinking to doing. The next two parts of this course are dedicated to prototyping. In this first part on physical prototyping, I will emphasize paper a lot and also talk a lot about sketching. In my mind, brainstorming translates to sketching alternate ideas. Rather than creating, for example, a mind map, I sketch to ideate. This is a practice that I will emphasize. We’ll start flat on paper but will quickly become more physical using specific paper templates and dioramas. We’ll also see how to create mostly physical prototypes, but how to enhance them with AR techniques, to move closer to our envisioned final XR experience. In the honors track, you will have two major exercises. You will first create an XR storyboard based on the XR app you have previously critiqued. The design critique and storyboarding will help you develop a new idea of improving the existing XR interface. You will then prototype your design concept using physical materials including paper, cardboard, Play-Doh, and transparency. I hope you will appreciate the freedom and flexibility that physical prototyping gives you, allowing you to create a new XR experience without many of the constraints of digital tools. The last module of this course will cover digital prototyping and user experience evaluation techniques for XR. While it is recommended to start prototyping on paper, it is crucial to experience a design concept for XR with XR technologies. I will introduce you to digital prototyping techniques as a way of increasing the fidelity of your prototype designs. You will learn about digital prototyping tools that support creating initial VR or AR experiences without the need for programming. Some tools support immersive authoring, which enables prototyping of XR experiences directly inside VR or AR. We will also learn about usability evaluation techniques and how to design and conduct a user study. Our final lecture will be on creating your XR portfolio as a way of effectively communicating and showcasing your design work. In the honors track, we will finalize our XR project with a digital prototype and submit our work for peer review. The peer review will not only provide important feedback on your work but also allow you to review and critique your peers’ work in a constructive way. I consider formulating good feedback and acting on critical feedback two vital skills for any designer but especially for those working in a space as rapidly evolving as XR. Welcome to XR for Everybody! When we say “for everybody,” we really do mean it. This specialization is designed to be a broad learning experience around all things augmented, virtual, and mixed reality. The 3 courses cover the fundamental concepts of XR, how to design and develop XR applications, how to discuss the emerging key issues in the landscape of XR, and how to bring XR into instructional settings. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:24h:1|2;Web Development

UCI’s unyielding commitment to rigorous academics, cutting-edge research, and leadership and character development makes the campus a driving force for innovation and discovery that serves our local, national and global communities in many ways. Welcome to this course on Networking and Security in iOS Applications.  Our focus in this course is very practitioner oriented.  We want to get you up and running using social networking integration with single sign-on, basic OAuth2 functionality, secure JSON web APIs, cryptographically secured push notifications, and secure data storage so that you can get apps into the iTunes ecosystem and out into the marketplace.  This course will have several code sessions in which we walk you through the process of building apps, some of which you will also build for peer review assignments.  Interspersed with the tutorials we will take time-outs to cover the basics of some concepts that might be mysterious without a more formal treatment.   Our hope is that you come out of this course knowing more (of course!) and having several projects that you can refer to in the future when you want to incorporate these techniques into your apps - your personal app toolbox.  The intensity picks up from the previous course in this Specialization, so get ready! Now it's time to consider what we are going to do if we want to work with web services that aren't deeply integrated into iOS.  There are hundreds (thousands?!?!) of them.   Most of them require authentication via the OAuth 2.0 protocol.  In this week's lessons we will walk through an example of getting a photo from Instagram on behalf of a user.   This week is also a code tutorial in preparation for your peer review assignment, but in the middle we need to step back from coding to cover some basics:  How do we use a UIImageView?  What is OAuth 2.0 anyway?  What is JSON and how do we read it? What's the big deal about http vs https anyway? In this week we will look at several aspects of push notifications.   Those are those alerts that show up at the top of your iOS interface when an app wants to get your attention.   There are several ways that they can be initiated.  They can be initiated from an app on a local device, or they can be initiated by a remote server somewhere on the internet.  Obtaining permission to post those notifications requires lots of steps, certificates, passwords etc.   We'll walk you through it all.   This week we start with a high-level overview of the iOS app lifecycle.  Then we will do three code tutorials.  The first will be the one that you will need to do the peer-review assessment.  It's a basic countdown timer that sends a notification at a specific time.  The second will show you how to make it all fancy with custom actions.  The final one will be for remote notifications.  Since remote notifications require an Apple developer account ($$$) we won't assess you on it, but if you have one you can try it out on your own and add it to your personal app toolbox. In this week we look at method of securely storing data on the iOS platform called Core Data.   This Specialization focuses on the basics of iOS application development. You’ll gain the skills you need to create your own app, including fluency in Objective-C and UIKit and SpriteKit user interface concepts, and you’ll learn to leverage networking, security, audio, video, location, and sensor frameworks. In the final Capstone Project, you’ll apply your skills to create a networked game that leverages sensors on the phone to create a unique gaming experience, and that you can showcase in job applications and interviews or offer in the iTunes store. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:49h:1|2;Javascript

Intellectual property is a commonly discussed, often misunderstand, element of entrepreneurship and law. Knowing how to create and manage patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets is a valuable skill for entrepreneurs and business leaders.  Regardless of size and industry, a business’s intellectual property is often more valuable than its physical assets. Companies invest tremendous resources in developing innovative new products and services. Intellectual property law discourages competitors from immediately profiting from another’s invention, and provides incentives for continued innovation.  Intellectual Property for Entrepreneurs is one of three courses in the Legal Aspects of Entrepreneurship Specialization by Coursera and the University of Maryland. This specialization explores the critical legal and business issues entrepreneurs face as they build and launch a new venture. Learners examine real-world scenarios and address legal and business issues from ideation to all of the important junctures along the path to success.

Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Wesleyan University, founded in 1831, is a diverse, energetic liberal arts community where critical thinking and practical idealism go hand in hand. With our distinctive scholar-teacher culture, creative programming, and commitment to interdisciplinary learning, Wesleyan challenges students to explore new ideas and change the world. Our graduates go on to lead and innovate in a wide variety of industries, including government, business, entertainment, and science. Property is where law and economics meet, but it's not a simple concept. Property is not an object or a relation between people and objects, but a set of rights, relations among people over who is to control each of the many uses to which objects can be put. Different people may control different uses of an object, that is, have different property rights over its various uses, at the same time, or control the same use of the object at different times. When new uses create disputes, the law must define new property rights and allocate them initially to resolve the dispute – someone must be deemed to have won the dispute and be given initial ownership of the new rights. But once the former disputants are allowed to trade these rights among themselves, surprising results follow.  Voluntary exchange implies mutual benefit – when people trade property rights, it's because they each believe that what they get from the trade will be more valuable to them than what they have to give up to get it. So if there are no obstacles to voluntary exchange, that is, if transaction costs are low, property rights will end up in the hands of the person who values them the most, a result economists call an efficient allocation of the rights. What happens when there are barriers that impede or prevent property rights from reaching their highest valuing owner through exchange? Can the law assign property rights to achieve efficient allocation in such cases? Should it try, or are there values other than efficient allocation the law might try to advance, along with or instead of efficient allocation, in assigning property rights? Exchange involves both benefit and cost – traders take rights from others, imposing costs on them but creating benefit for themselves, but they must compensate the others for their costs by paying for the rights they've taken. External costs are imposed when one person takes another's rights without paying for them, which leads to the taker taking more rights than efficient allocation would allow and leaves the victim uncompensated for the costs of losing the rights. The law's response to this inefficiency and injustice is liability, forcing those who take rights without payment to compensate those whose rights they have taken for the costs they have borne. Thinking about how the law determines these liability prices, and how people might respond to them, reveals the underlying economic logic of liability. Some externalities involve only a few uncompensated losers of rights whose costs are easily reckoned in monetary terms, so that forcing the taker to pay exactly these costs to the victims ensures both that victims will be fairly compensated and that takers will take rights only where they value the rights more than the losers do. The law calls these externalities torts, and the same principle of liability pricing extends to crimes, in which, with the same unlawful act, someone simultaneously takes the rights of many people who suffer moral costs that can't be satisfactorily measured by money. As with torts, some crimes may be efficient reallocations of rights, and the logic of liability shows that proportional punishment can, ideally, discover which crimes are or are not efficient and force all takers to compensate their victims in full for what they take. The concept of property is developed in two new directions. One concerns the problem of eminent domain and evokes the ancient conflict between individual rights and collective needs – in what circumstances, and to what extent, should private property be protected against uncompensated taking by government? How do the different theories of property considered earlier each answer this question? The other asks how voluntary exchange can be organized when technology makes it easy for people to take others' property rights without compensation. If existing rights are insufficient to prevent these takings from occurring on a large enough scale to make voluntary exchange impossible, new kinds of property rights are needed to encourage efficient levels of production and exchange. This is illustrated by the problem of intellectual goods and the new forms of property that have evolved over centuries to make exchange in ideas possible. Criminal liability means that crimes have prices, and how these prices are exacted in practice from people who take rights without compensation is the problem of criminal procedure. How do judges know who is guilty, and what prices guilty people should be made to pay for their crimes? Around the world, two major systems of adjudicating guilt and punishment, the adversarial and the inquisitorial, have evolved over centuries to answer these questions in individual cases, with very different procedures to assess guilt and punishment that express different commitments to truth and fairness. All these procedures are expensive, and governments everywhere must confront the problem of processing large caseloads with limited resources. This has led the inquisitorial systems of Europe and the adversarial systems of England and the United States to new procedures of adjudication that may be reducing the differences between them.  ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:33h:1|2;Java

A kurzus során bemutatjuk, hogyan használ az agy a tanuláshoz két nagyon különböző állapotot, és hogyan tudja tömbösíteni az információt. Szó lesz továbbá kompetencia-illúziókról, memóriatechnikákról, a halogatás kezeléséről, és a legjobb gyakorlatokról, amelyek kutatások alapján a leghatékonyabb segítséget nyújtják nehéz tárgyak tanulásában.  Ezek a módszerek a tanulandó területen való jártasságtól függetlenül képesek megváltoztatni a gondolkodásunkat, ezen keresztül pedig az életünket is. Ha valaki máris szakértő, az agy rejtelmeibe való betekintés akkor is hasznos lesz a következőkben: új lendületet kaphat a tanulásban elért sikereihez, olyan vizsgatippeket ismerhet meg, amelyekre nem is gondolt volna, és olyan meglátásokra tehet szert, amelyek segítenek optimalizálni a házi feladattal és a feladatmegoldással töltött időt. Ha valakinek nehezére esik a tanulás, itt a praktikák olyan áttekinthető tárházára bukkan, amelynek segítségével fel tudja venni a fonalat. Ha valaha is arra vágytunk, hogy valamiben fejlődni tudjunk, akkor ez a kurzus szolgálhat számunkra útmutatóként.   A tanulás tanulása: Hatékony mentális eszközök, amelyek segítenek megbirkózni a nehéz tantárgyakkal című Coursera kurzus Barbara Oakley és Terrence Sejnowsky Learning How to Learn (LHTL) kurzusának magyar változata, mely a Szegedi Tudományegyetem munkatársai közreműködésével valósult meg.  A kurzus felvehető az angol nyelvű Mindshift („Szemléletváltás”) elnevezésű, kapcsolódó kurzustól függetlenül, azzal párhuzamosan, vagy akár előtte. (A tanulás tanulása fókuszában inkább a tanulás áll, a Mindshift fókuszában pedig inkább a karrierépítés.)

Bár az élő agy nagyon bonyolult, ez a modul metaforákat és analógiákat használva segít megérteni a működését.  Alapvetően különböző gondolkodásmódokat fognak felfedezni, és megtudhatják, hogyan használhatják ezeket a tanulás hatékonyságának növeléséhez.  Megismerkednek a halogatás kezelésével, és praktikus ismereteket szereznek a memóriáról, ráadásul meglepően hasznos információkhoz juthatnak a tanulás és az alvás kapcsolatáról.     (Felhívjuk figyelmét, hogy ennek a modulnak az elvégzése egy órát vesz igénybe - az efölötti idő a választható tevékenységekre vonatkozik.) Ebben a modulban a tömbökről fogunk beszélni. A tömbök olyan kompakt csomagok, amelyekhez az elme könnyen hozzáférhet. Szó lesz arról, hogyan tudunk tömböket formálni, hogyan használjuk őket a tananyag megértésének javítására és a kreativitás fejlesztésére, és hogy hogyan segítenek a tömbök abban, hogy a dolgozatokon jobban teljesítsünk. Megvizsgáljuk a tanulás során tapasztalt kompetencia illúzióját, a túltanulás kihívásait és az időszakos tanulás előnyeit.  Ebben a modulban két szorosan összefüggő fogalomról lesz szó, a halogatásról és a memóriáról. Sok időbe telik az olyan stabil tömbök kiépítése a hosszú távú memóriában, amelyeket a rövid távú memóriánk könnyen el tud érni. Ezért olyan fontos a halogatás kezelése. Végezetül pedig megemlítjük a legjobb módszereket, amelyek segítségével hozzá tudunk férni az agyunk leghatékonyabb memóriarendszereihez.  Ebben a modulban még többet szólunk az olyan fontos gondolatokról és módszerekről, amelyek fejlesztik a tanulási képességeinket. Az is kiderül, hogyan tudunk hasznosabban együttműködni tanulótársainkkal, hogyan tudjuk számba venni az erősségeinket, és hogyan tudjuk elkerülni az imposztor-szindrómát. A vadászpilóták és a sebészek feladatlistákat használnak a fontos teeindőik elvégzéséhez – ilyet bárki használhat a vizsgákra való felkészülés során.

It allows automated analysis based on behavioural models of a system to see if a system works correctly. We want to guarantee that the systems does exactly what it is supposed to do. The techniques put forward in system validation allow to prove the absence of errors. It allows to design embedded system behaviour that is structurally sound and as a side effect enforces you to make the behaviour simple and insightful. This means that the systems are not only behaving correctly, but are also much easier to maintain and adapt. ’Requirements by modal formulas' is the third course that shows you how to specify requirements for the automata in order to establish the correct relation between the requirements and the behaviour of the system.

Please visit https://www.eitdigital.eu/eit-digital-academy/ In this module you learn how to specify requirements on behaviour. First Hennessy-Milner logic is explained, which is subsequently extended with fixed-points. Using this logic you will be able to formally characterise virtually any behavioral property on the behavior of software. This varies from simple properties such as a system is free from deadlocks, to complex properties such as in a warehouse the controllers will instruct all the robots such that my ordered item will appear for certain within finite time at the output. This module elaborates on modal formulas. It shows how to use data in the formulas which makes modelling of complex properties much easier. Furthermore, it shows how fairness properties can be modelled in the framework using nested fixed point operators. The last lectures introduce parameterised boolean equation systems and boolean equation systems as important technology to establish that a modal formula is valid for a particular specified behaviour.  ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:12h:1|2;Web Development

Course Learning Outcomes:  ● Outcome 1: Decompose a problem and set of basic real-time requirements into software modules and Linux POSIX real-time threads ● Outcome 2: Analyze services in terms of C (execution time), T (request period), and D (deadlines for completion) to establish feasibility and margin for meeting requirements ● Outcome 3: Design and construct a solution for a native Linux system equipped with a webcam to verify and demonstrate system synchronization using machine vision processing Subtitles: English Subtitles: English CU-Boulder is a dynamic community of scholars and learners on one of the most spectacular college campuses in the country. As one of 34 U.S. public institutions in the prestigious Association of American Universities (AAU), we have a proud tradition of academic excellence, with five Nobel laureates and more than 50 members of prestigious academic academies. This module provides background on the RTES project including the concept of a visual synchronome, where a camera is used to synchronize time between an external clock and an embedded computer.  The project requires synchronization at both 1 Hz and 10 Hz, where the real-time services must acquire camera frames, select stable (non-blurred) frames and write them to a flash file system.  The project requires a good understanding of RMA, real-time scheduling, and design principles for multi-service real-time systems. Different design approaches for the RTES project are reviewed in this module including the shot gun start, where clock ticks are detected once at the start, the full synchronome continuous tick detection approach, and different options for implementation.  RTES project designers must decide on a camera interface, for example a V4L2 (Video for Linux 2) interface to UVC (Universal Video Controller) driver, or an OpenCV interface to a camera. To ensure that a real-time design is properly implemented, timing analysis based upon system logging and tracing must be used to verify that actual timing compared to theoretical RMA.  This module provides and overview of methods and suggests the most efficient methods to debug and verify timing of the RTES project.  The module includes a 1 Hz peer review of design and code to assist with RTES project improvement for external clock synchronization using camera images with a ticking analog clock. This module covers methods of tracing and profiling for the overall RTES project platform including networking, system profiling, and methods to trace real-time services in particular.  The module includes a 10 Hz peer review of design and code to assist with RTES project improvement for external clock synchronization with a digital stopwatch at this higher rate compared to 1 Hz. The overall RTES project should be completed for this module.  Students can review tips and examples for how to prepare their design materials, their RMA, and code for review.  The process for inspection to verify and validate the design based upon the RTES project rubric is defined here as well. The Real-Time Embedded Systems specialization is a series of four course taking you from a beginning practitioner, to a more advanced real-time system analyst and designer. Knowledge and experience gained on hard to master topics such as predictable response services, when to allocate requirements to hardware or software, as well as mission critical design will enhance your engineering talent. You will gain experience building a simple, but real, system project with real-time challenges, that will boost your confidence. The hands-on, at home, project hardware is affordable, widely available, and quick-time-to market methods leverage Linux real-time extensions, open source RTOS (Real-Time Operating System), as well as tried and true cyclic executives.  After you complete all four courses in the series, you can consider yourself an intermediate to more advanced real-time system practitioner. This knowledge is invaluable for medical, aerospace, transportation, energy, digital entertainment, telecommunications, and other exciting embedded career options.  The series stresses hands-on practice and assessment of your learning progress, not only based on knowledge acquisition, but by teaching you to put theory into practice and how to evaluate design options and make optimal choices. The unique final project allows you to see real-time challenges with your eyes, to debug interactively, and build a simple at-home detection, tracking and synchronization system. ;10;1;1;Długość kursu:18h:1|2;Algorithms

Legacy code is code written by others that’s inherited by a team or programmer. The issue working with legacy code is that it can often be difficult and time consuming to update and maintain. Learn some proven techniques on how to refactor your legacy code with the help of agile methodologies such as unit tests and test driven development.  Continuous integration (CI) is a pillar in modern software development. It’s the process in which a code base is rapidly developed during the course of the business day.  Continuous delivery is taking the steps to be able to have your software delivered at any time. It’s similar to continuous deployment with the distinction that it is manual as opposed to automated. In this section we’ll take a closer look at continuous delivery and how it intertwines with a related concept of continual deployment.  Exception handling is a way for coders to help make their code less vulnerable to errors. A proactive developer will consider invalid input that a user may enter into a program and process this error gracefully.  In this Test-Driven Development Specialization, we will take a hands-on look at Test-Driven Development by writing and implementing tests from the first module. You'll be translating user specs into unit tests, applying the Red-Green-Refactor mantra, and applying mocks in python with the unit test mock module.

Jacobi forms are holomorphic functions in two complex variables. They are modular in one variable and abelian (or double periodic) in another variable. The theory of Jacobi modular forms became an independent research subject after the famous book of Martin Eichler and Don Zagier “Jacobi modular forms” (Progress in Mathematics, vol. 55, 1985) which was cited more than a thousand times in research papers. This is due to many applications of Jacobi forms in arithmetic, topology, algebraic and differential geometry, mathematical and theoretical physics, in the theory of Lie algebras, etc. The list of mentioned subjects shows that my course might be useful for master and Ph.D. students working in different directions. Motivated undergraduate students can also study this subject. To follow the course one has to know only elementary basic facts from the theory of modular forms (for example, the paragraphs 1-4 of the chapter VII of Serre’s “A Course in Arithmetic” are enough). The main hero of the course is the Jacobi theta-series. Using it we will construct a lot of concrete examples of Jacobi forms in one or many abelian variables, in particular, Jacobi forms for root systems. For some of you, who will be successful with the theoretical exercises of the course, I am ready to formulate research problems for Master or Ph.D. thesis.

In this module, we look at how we can persist data to files so that it will exist beyond a single execution of a program.  We will look at how we can write data to files in both text and binary formats.  We follow-up with ways to read that data back into the state of an executing program. In this module, we look at how to implement the is-a relationships we modeled earlier in our UML diagrams through the use of Inheritance.  Inheritance provides additional ways to abstract code in taxonomies where base classes share code with specialized versions of the classes.  We will add a discussion about exceptions work in Visual Basic now that we can discuss inheritance.  In this module, we extend our implementation of the is-a relationships so that our code can work with specializations of a class without knowing the specifics of the specialization.  This level of abstraction is known as polymorphism. Polymorphism provides additional ways to abstract code to work on objects in a taxonomy.  In this module, we continue our deep dive into the implementation of the is-a relationships.  In our early work, we developed taxonomies for the purposes of abstraction.  Now we want to think about the situation where a class could be in several taxonomies.  This level of abstraction is known as an interface in modern programming. Interfaces provide signatures but not implementation so that we can use Polymorphism on objects that fall in multiple taxonomies. This specialization is for anyone interested in learning more about computer programming, including the fundamental computer science knowledge and skills required for work in this field. Through 4 courses in this Specialization, you'll develop a foundation in the fundamentals of programming, including knowledge and skills essential for a career in information technology and data science.

Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish A premier institution of higher education, The University of Virginia offers outstanding academics, world-class faculty, and an inspiring, supportive environment. Founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, the University is guided by his vision of discovery, innovation, and development of the full potential of students from all walks of life. Through these courses, global learners have an opportunity to study with renowned scholars and thought leaders. At its core, software is about automating tasks that machines can do better than humans, and you'll go straight to the heart of that with this week's case and related practice. You'll use Javascript to extract, transform, and load/render external data- a Google Sheet. More than ever, modern software development is about integrating pre-existing code and services. Rarely is a modern application built from scratch. As you’ve seen, creating and maintaining code is a lot of work, so it’s better to leverage basic building blocks that someone else has created and is maintaining. This week, you’ll work with some code that interfaces to Google’s Firebase, a popular ‘back end as a service’ platform. Like the first two courses in the specialization, in this last week you’ll apply what you’ve learned to your coding project. You’ve got a lot more breadth in your coding skills now, which is awesome! However, now it’s even more important that you anchor yourself in the user story and prototype you selected to make sure you know what you’re trying to have happen with your code. Otherwise, it’s easy to end up confused.  While I hope you’re now comfortable using it, you do not have to use Google Firebase, though that’s certainly an option.   Note 1: If you started here in the specialization, you’ll want to work from the options in the brief to build a prototype on JS Fiddle in HTML and CSS, and then layer in some Javascript.   Note 2: If you’d like to start with a new concept from the brief for this course, that’s fine. In this specialization, you will experience what it is to go from idea to code. These courses are specifically created for the manager, designer, or entrepreneur who is an active, hands-on collaborator with developers. By the end of the program, you will be able to build working software using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. More important, you will build your creative confidence (and competency!) on engaging in digital projects. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:31h:1|2;Web Development

It uses the programming system and language called MATLAB to do so because it is easy to learn, versatile and very useful for engineers and other professionals. MATLAB is a special-purpose language that is an excellent choice for writing moderate-size programs that solve problems involving the manipulation of numbers. The design of the language makes it possible to write a powerful program in a few lines. The problems may be relatively complex, while the MATLAB programs that solve them are relatively simple: relative, that is, to the equivalent program written in a general-purpose language, such as C++ or Java. As a result, MATLAB is being used in a wide variety of domains from the natural sciences, through all disciplines of engineering, to finance, and beyond, and it is heavily used in industry. Hence, a solid background in MATLAB is an indispensable skill in today’s job market. Nevertheless, this course is not a MATLAB tutorial. It is an introductory programming course that uses MATLAB to illustrate general concepts in computer science and programming. Students who successfully complete this course will become familiar with general concepts in computer science, gain an understanding of the general concepts of programming, and obtain a solid foundation in the use of MATLAB.  Students taking the course will get a MATLAB Online license free of charge for the duration of the course. The students are encouraged to consult the eBook that this course is based on. More information about these resources can be found on the Resources menu on the right. Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Greek, Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Greek, Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Vanderbilt University, located in Nashville, Tenn., is a private research university and medical center offering a full-range of undergraduate, graduate and professional degrees. We will learn how to start MATLAB and will familiarize ourselves with its user interface. We will learn how to use MATLAB as a sophisticated calculator. We will learn about syntax and semantics. We will see ways in which MATLAB provides help. Finally, we will learn how to create plots in MATLAB. The basic unit with which we work in MATLAB is the matrix. We solve problems by manipulating matrices, and operators are the primary means by which we manipulate them. We will learn how to define matrices, extract parts of them and combine them to form new matrices. We will learn how to use operators to add, subtract, multiply, and divide matrices, and we will learn that there are several different types of multiplication and division. Finally, we will learn MATLAB’s rules for determining the order in which operators are carried out when more than one of them appear in the same expression. Functions let us break up complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts. We will learn how functions let us create reusable software components that can be applied in many different programs. We will learn how the environment inside a function is separated from the outside via a well defined interface through which it communicates with that outside world. We will learn how to define a function to allow input to it when it initiates its execution and output from it when it is done. MATLAB has useful built-in functions and we will explore many of them in this section. We will learn about polymorphism and how MATLAB exploits it to change a function's behavior on the basis of the number and type of its inputs. Because random numbers play an important role in computer programming, we will learn how to use the MATLAB random number generator. We will learn how to get input from the keyboard, how to print to the Command Window, and how to plot graphs in a Figure window. Finally, we will learn how to find programming errors with the help of the debugger. Selection is the means by which MATLAB makes decisions about the order in which it executes its statements. We will learn how to use the if-statement, which is the most important method of selection. We will learn how to use relational operators and logical operators. We will learn how to write polymorphic functions and how to make functions resistant to error. Loops give computers their power. We will learn how to use both of MATLAB's loop constructs: the for-loop and the while-loop. We will learn how the break-statement works, and we will use nested loops. We will learn how to make loops more efficient. We will learn about logical indexing and will see how to use it to produce implicit loops that are efficient and easy for a user to understand. Computers operate on bits, but humans think in terms of numbers, words, and other types of data. Like any good language, MATLAB organizes bits into convenient data types. We will study those types in this section. We will learn that there are ten types of numbers and that there are conversion functions to change one type into another. We will learn much more about strings and how the characters in them are encoded as numbers. We will learn how to produce heterogeneous collections of data via structs and cells, and we will learn how to store points in time and time durations. Files are named areas in permanent memory for storing data that can be used as input or output to MATLAB and to other programs. We will be introduced to MATLAB’s most important methods for reading and writing files. We will learn how to create, read from, and write into MAT-files, Excel files, text files, and binary files. We will learn how to navigate among folders with MATLAB commands. This Specialization aims to take learners with little to no programming experience to being able to create MATLAB programs that solve real-world problems in engineering and the sciences. The focus is on computer programming in general, but the numerous language features that make MATLAB uniquely suited to engineering and scientific computing are also covered in depth. Topics presented range from basic programming concepts in the first course, through more advanced techniques including recursion, program efficiency, Object Oriented Programming, graphical user interfaces in the second course, to data and image analysis, data visualization and machine learning in the third course. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:42h:1|2;Java

Answer: CAD software tools.  Learn how to build thesA modern VLSI chip is a remarkably complex beast:  billions of transistors, millions of logic gates deployed for computation and control, big blocks of memory, embedded blocks of pre-designed functions designed by third parties (called “intellectual property” or IP blocks).  How do people manage to design these complicated chips?  Answer: a sequence of computer aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines it step-wise to a final design. This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design. Our focus in this first part of the course is on key Boolean logic representations that make it possible to synthesize, and to verify, the gate-level logic in these designs.  This is the first step of the design chain, as we move from logic to layout.    Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures. Topics covered will include: Computational Boolean algebra, logic verification, and logic synthesis (2-level and multi-level). Recommended Background Programming experience (C, C++, Java, Python, etc.) and basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms (especially recursive algorithms).  An understanding of basic digital design:  Boolean algebra, Kmaps, gates and flip flops, finite state machine design.  Linear algebra and calculus at the level of a junior or senior in engineering.  Exposure to basic VLSI at an undergraduate level is nice -- but it’s not necessary.

In this module you will become familiar with the course and our learning environment. The orientation will also help you obtain the technical skills required for the course. In this module, we will introduce advanced Boolean algebra math concepts that make it possible to take a computational approach to Boolean algebra.  Week 2 introduces two powerful and important representation techniques that allow us to do SERIOUS computational Boolean algebra, on industrial-scale designs. In Week 3, we will move from representing things to synthesizing things. In this case, synthesis means optimization, or maybe the word minimization is more familiar from hand work with Kmaps or Boolean algebra. You now know that to factor a multi-level network to reduce its complexity, you must look at the kernels and co-kernels. You know how to get these for any node. But -- what do you do with a big network to actually FIND the right common divisors? This is called EXTRACTION. We then look at a new opportunity to optimize multi-level logic: Don't Cares. In simple designs, we usually regard Don't Cares as impossible inputs -- things that just do not happen, so we can choose the value the hardware creates to minimize the logic.

This means less operational overhead for you and your business, and more focusing on the applications and business specific projects that differentiate you in your marketplace. In this course, we will be covering how to build a modern, greenfield serverless backend on AWS.  Building brand new applications on AWS is a different task than lifting and shifting existing applications into AWS. When you have an existing application that you need to move to AWS, you might first look to using Amazon EC2 as your virtual machines, or maybe you might look into using docker containers and container hosting services like Amazon Elastic Container Service or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service. Those are all great application hosting options, but in most cases, they still require you to have some kind of pulse on the underlying infrastructure hosting your application.  `  Building Modern Python Applications on AWS will explore how to build an API driven application using Amazon API Gateway for serverless API hosting, AWS Lambda for serverless computing, and Amazon Cognito for serverless authentication. We will follow an API driven development process and first mock up what the API will look like. We will cover all the ins and outs of the service Amazon API Gateway, and as you’ll learn- it does a lot more than just hosting an API.   Then we will add authentication to the API using Amazon Cognito. You’ll learn about how the authorization flow works with Cognito, and how to build it into your APIs. From there, we will add a Lambda backend that will be triggered by API Gateway. The lambda functions will be using the AWS SDKs to perform various data processing tasks. You’ll learn about the different configurations that exist for Lambda, and we will show you how to create and manage lambda functions. Some of the features of our API will require multiple lambda functions to execute in a specific order, like a workflow, and we will use AWS Step Functions to create a serverless workflow. Finally, we will talk about how to optimize your APIs at every layer using AWS features.  Note: There are four versions of this class, Building Modern Node.js Applications on AWS for Node.js developers, Building Modern Java Applications on AWS for Java developers, Building Modern .NET Applications on AWS for .NET developers, and this course, Building Modern Python Applications on AWS for Python developers. The courses do for a large part, overlap and in general, we recommend that you take the course that focuses on the SDK you plan to use to develop your AWS Cloud based applications.  We expect that you have basic knowledge of AWS already. Some examples of concepts you should be familiar with are: you should know the basics of the AWS Global infrastructure, like what regions and availability zones are. You also should know the at a high-level AWS Identity and Access Management, or IAM, and how it is used to control access to AWS resources. You should also understand what an Amazon EC2 instance is, what Amazon S3 is, what a VPC is, as well as other basic AWS terminology.

We begin with the foundational technical and cloud knowledge that you need to have to build in the AWS Cloud. In the first course, you will be introduced to several AWS compute services, different storage and database offerings that AWS provides, AWS’ networking capabilities, monitoring capabilities and the AWS IAM service. The second course of the specialization explores how to build an API driven application using Amazon API Gateway for serverless API hosting, AWS Lambda for serverless computing and Amazon Cognito for serverless authentication.  Modern applications require a modern database. Hence, the third course introduces you to NoSQL databases and the challenges they solve. We will dive deep into Amazon DynamoDB topics such as recovery, SDKs, partition keys, security and encryption, global tables, stateless applications, streams, and best practices. DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.  Finally, you’ll learn how to use Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer to detect issues and identify recommendations to improve the quality and security of your code.

This is evidenced by the popularity of MapReduce and Hadoop, and most recently Apache Spark, a fast, in-memory distributed collections framework written in Scala. In this course, we'll see how the data parallel paradigm can be extended to the distributed case, using Spark throughout. We'll cover Spark's programming model in detail, being careful to understand how and when it differs from familiar programming models, like shared-memory parallel collections or sequential Scala collections. Through hands-on examples in Spark and Scala, we'll learn when important issues related to distribution like latency and network communication should be considered and how they can be addressed effectively for improved performance. Learning Outcomes. By the end of this course you will be able to:  - read data from persistent storage and load it into Apache Spark, - manipulate data with Spark and Scala, - express algorithms for data analysis in a functional style,  - recognize how to avoid shuffles and recomputation in Spark,  Recommended background: You should have at least one year programming experience.

We'll look at important concerns that arise in distributed systems, like latency and failure. We'll go on to cover the basics of Spark, a functionally-oriented framework for big data processing in Scala. We'll end the first week by exercising what we learned about Spark by immediately getting our hands dirty analyzing a real-world data set. This week, we'll look at a special kind of RDD called pair RDDs. With this specialized kind of RDD in hand, we'll cover essential operations on large data sets, such as reductions and joins. This week we'll look at some of the performance implications of using operations like joins. Is it possible to get the same result without having to pay for the overhead of moving data over the network? We'll answer this question by delving into how we can partition our data to achieve better data locality, in turn optimizing some of our Spark jobs. With our newfound understanding of the cost of data movement in a Spark job, and some experience optimizing jobs for data locality last week, this week we'll focus on how we can more easily achieve similar optimizations. Can structured data help us? We'll look at Spark SQL and its powerful optimizer which uses structure to apply impressive optimizations. We'll move on to cover DataFrames and Datasets, which give us a way to mix RDDs with the powerful automatic optimizations behind Spark SQL.

This means less operational overhead for you and your business, and more focusing on the applications and business specific projects that differentiate you in your marketplace. In this course, we will be covering how to build a modern, greenfield serverless backend on AWS.  Building brand new applications on AWS is a different task than lifting and shifting existing applications into AWS. When you have an existing application that you need to move to AWS, you might first look to using Amazon EC2 as your virtual machines, or maybe you might look into using docker containers and container hosting services like Amazon Elastic Container Service or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service. Those are all great application hosting options, but in most cases, they still require you to have some kind of pulse on the underlying infrastructure hosting your application.  `  Building Modern .NET Applications on AWS will explore how to build an API driven application using Amazon API Gateway for serverless API hosting, AWS Lambda for serverless computing, and Amazon Cognito for serverless authentication. We will follow an API driven development process and first mock up what the API will look like. We will cover all the ins and outs of the service Amazon API Gateway, and as you’ll learn- it does a lot more than just hosting an API.   Then we will add authentication to the API using Amazon Cognito. You’ll learn about how the authorization flow works with Cognito, and how to build it into your APIs. From there, we will add a Lambda backend that will be triggered by API Gateway. The lambda functions will be using the AWS SDKs to perform various data processing tasks. You’ll learn about the different configurations that exist for Lambda, and we will show you how to create and manage lambda functions. Some of the features of our API will require multiple lambda functions to execute in a specific order, like a workflow, and we will use AWS Step Functions to create a serverless workflow. Finally, we will talk about how to optimize your APIs at every layer using AWS features.  Note: There are four versions of this class, Building Modern Node.js Applications on AWS for Node.js developers, Building Modern Python Applications on AWS for Python developers, Building Modern Java Applications on AWS for Java developers, and this course, Building Modern .NET Applications on AWS for .NET developers.  The courses do for a large part, overlap and in general, we recommend that you take the course that focuses on the SDK you plan to use to develop your AWS Cloud based applications.  We expect that you have basic knowledge of AWS already. Some examples of concepts you should be familiar with are: you should know the basics of the AWS Global infrastructure, like what regions and availability zones are. You also should know the at a high-level AWS Identity and Access Management, or IAM, and how it is used to control access to AWS resources. You should also understand what an Amazon EC2 instance is, what Amazon S3 is, what a VPC is, as well as other basic AWS terminology. Subtitles: English Subtitles: English Since 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. AWS offers over 90 fully featured services for compute, storage, networking, database, analytics, application services, deployment, management, developer, mobile, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence, security, hybrid and enterprise applications, from 44 Availability Zones across 16 geographic regions.  AWS services are trusted by millions of active customers around the world — including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies — to power their infrastructure, make them more agile, and lower costs.  Coursera and AWS have been partners since 2017 providing learners and enterprises globally, the skills they need to succeed.  Coursera builds on AWS servers to scale with student demand with confidence around capacity and elasticity and in partnership with AWS.  In 2019, Coursera achieved Advanced Tier Partner status and further extended the partnership with AWS Educate, AWS EdStart and AWS Academy collaborations.   Coursera's been able to make cloud skills more accessible with 8 AWS courses on the Coursera platform featuring top subject matter experts and the portfolio continues to grow.    To learn more about AWS, visit https://aws.amazon.com. This specialization is designed to help you master the skills of designing and building cloud-native applications on AWS. We begin with the foundational technical and cloud knowledge that you need to have to build in the AWS Cloud. In the first course, you will be introduced to several AWS compute services, different storage and database offerings that AWS provides, AWS’ networking capabilities, monitoring capabilities and the AWS IAM service. The second course in the specialization explores how to build an API driven application using Amazon API Gateway for serverless API hosting, AWS Lambda for serverless computing, and Amazon Cognito for serverless authentication.  Modern applications require a modern database. Hence, the third course introduces you to NoSQL databases and the challenges they solve. We will dive deep into Amazon DynamoDB topics such as recovery, SDKs, partition keys, security and encryption, global tables, stateless applications, streams, and best practices. Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.  Note: There are 4 versions of this specialization.

You'll get to know important new functional programming concepts, from lazy evaluation to structuring your libraries using monads. We'll work on larger and more involved examples, from state space exploration to random testing to discrete circuit simulators. You’ll also learn some best practices on how to write good Scala code in the real world. Finally, you will learn how to leverage the ability of the compiler to infer values from types. Several parts of this course deal with the question how functional programming interacts with mutable state. We will explore the consequences of combining functions and state. We will also look at purely functional alternatives to mutable state, using infinite data structures or functional reactive programming.  Recommended background: You should have at least one year programming experience. Proficiency with Java or CSharp is ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript or Ruby is also sufficient. You should have some familiarity with using the command line. This course is intended to be taken after Functional Programming Principles in Scala: https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala2-functional-programming. Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Chinese (Simplified), Italian, Vietnamese, Korean, German, Russian, Turkish, English, Spanish Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Chinese (Simplified), Italian, Vietnamese, Korean, German, Russian, Turkish, English, Spanish We'll start by revisiting some concepts that we have learned from Principles of Functional Programming in Scala collections, pattern matching, and functions. We'll then touch on for-comprehensions, a powerful way in Scala to traverse a list, process it, and return a new list. We'll see how to do queries with for-comprehensions as well as how the for-comprehension is desugared into calls to higher-order functions by the Scala compiler. Finally, we'll discuss what monads are, and how to verify that the monad laws are satisfied for a number of examples. This week we'll revisit performance issues caused by combinatorial search, and we'll discover an important concept in functional programming that can address these issues: laziness. We'll also learn a little bit about proofs on trees in particular, we'll see how to extend structural induction to trees. This week, we’ll learn how to make the compiler write programs for us! We’ll see how the compiler can summon program fragments based on their type and how this mechanism can be used to implement a new form of polymorphism (type classes). This week, we'll learn about state and side-effects. Through a rich example, we'll learn programming patterns for managing state in larger programs. We'll also learn about for-loops and while-loops in Scala. This week we'll learn a number of important programming patterns via examples, starting with the observer pattern, and then going on to functional reactive programming. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:18h:1|2;Algorithms

Pero, ¿Qué pasa si realmente quieres entender cómo se creó la página? Hay excelentes libros de texto y recursos en línea para aprender diseño web, pero la mayoría de esos recursos requieren algunos conocimientos previos. Este curso está diseñado para ayudar al principiante que quiere ganar confianza y conocimientos. Exploraremos la teoría (¿Qué sucede realmente cuando se hace clic en un enlace en una página web?), lo práctico (¿Qué necesito saber para hacer mi propia página?) y lo pasado por alto (tengo una página, ¿Qué hago ahora?).  A lo largo del curso se dará un fuerte énfasis en adherirse a los estándares sintácticos para la validación y estándares semánticos a fin de  promover una amplia accesibilidad para los usuarios con discapacidades.  El libro de texto que usamos está disponible en línea, “The Missing Link: An Introduction to Web Development and Programming” (“El Enlace Pedido: Una Introducción al Desarrollo y a la Programación Web) por Michael Méndez, en www.opensuny.org.   Este curso atraerá a una amplia variedad de personas, pero específicamente a aquellos que deseen una descripción paso a paso de los conceptos básicos. No hay requisitos previos para este curso y se asume que los estudiantes no tienen habilidades de programación previas o experiencia en TI.   El curso culminará con un pequeño proyecto que requerirá la realización de una página muy sencilla con enlaces e imágenes. El enfoque de este curso está en lo básico, no en la apariencia. Puedes ver un ejemplo de página final en http://intro-webdesign.com/html5-plain.html.    Este es el primer curso de la Especialización en Diseño Web para todo el mundo. Los cursos posteriores se centran en las habilidades comercializables de estilizar la página con CSS3, agregar interactividad con JavaScript y mejorar el estilo con un diseño receptivo.

Esta semana descubriremos el “misterio” detrás de Internet. ¿Qué sucede cuando escribes una URL en tu navegador para que aparezca una página web por arte de magia? ¿Qué es HTML5 y qué pasó con HTML 1-4? También cubriremos algunos conceptos prácticos que debes dominar antes de comenzar a codificar tus propias páginas. Esta semana tendrás que respirar profundamente y saltar dentro de la codificación.  Cubriré un gran número de etiquetas HTML, pero es importante que hagas algo más que escuchar estos videos y leer el material del libro de texto.  Necesitas practicar (¡y equivocarte!) para aprender.     Lo creas o no, una vez que domines la idea básica de usar etiquetas y atributos, sabrás todo lo que necesitas para usar cualquier etiqueta HTML5.  Es posible que la página no tenga la apariencia que deseas que tenga todavía, ¡pero podrás  usar texto, enlaces, imágenes, tablas e incluso música y videos!    Si deseas consultar un libro de texto esta semana para reforzar los conceptos, usaremos el libro de texto en línea Shay Howe como referencia.  Incluiré enlaces después de las conferencias, pero algunos estudiantes prefieren leer antes de los videos.  (Mi enfoque preferido es leer/ver/leer de nuevo). Bien, creaste un archivo... ¿y ahora qué?  Esta semana comenzaremos tratando los conceptos importantes pero a menudo pasados por alto de validación y accesibilidad. ¿Seguiste la estructura DOM cuando creaste tu página? ¿Usaste etiquetas semánticas para asegurarte de que quien vea la página pueda acceder a toda la información, incluso si tiene discapacidades físicas o cognitivas?   Este es un conocimiento que puedes utilizar si deseas seguir una carrera como especialista en accesibilidad web.

What does it mean to have responsive design for your site?  How can you tell if your existing site is responsive?  This week we will begin with the theories behind the mobile-first paradigm -  the idea that your mobile site should provide everything needed, not a pared-down version of a good page.  We end the week by taking the first concrete step of using fluid measurements in your CSS. This week you will get a chance to put the theories into practice using media queries in your CSS.  These queries can automatically detect the size of the browser being used to view the page so that you can decide what type of look you want to achieve.  There will also be a discussion on common practices for designing your different views at various screen sizes (viewports). After every good programmer has put in time creating sites from scratch, it is common to utilize existing tools out there.  After all, why recreate the wheel?  The work you have done up to this point will give you the knowledge needed to craft your own unique sites from these frameworks.  This week we will work with Bootstrap, a framework that uses HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript (but don't worry if you have never used JavaScript yourself). This week is dedicated to solving those little issues that pop up when you move from theory to practice.  We look at more advanced framework options and also hear from people who are using the techniques covered in this course. This Specialization covers how to write syntactically correct HTML5 and CSS3, and how to create interactive web experiences with JavaScript.

Во введении мы коротко расскажем вам о том, для кого предназначен данный курс и из каких модулей он состоит. Основная цель данного мини-модуля – сориентировать вас на тему того, будет ли наш курс вам интересен, и объяснить, какие инструменты вам потребуются для его успешного прохождения. В этом модуле вы научитесь как создавать простые последовательные функции, так и использовать (вызывать) уже имеющийся код. Кроме того, вы узнаете о том, что такое типы и выражения, и как важно давать всему правильные имена. Данный модуль познакомит вас с такой штукой как ветвления – специальные операторы, позволяющие управлять тем, какой код должен выполняться в зависимости от заданного условия. Также вы узнаете, как можно описывать эти самые условия при помощи логических функций. В программировании часто возникают ситуации, когда один и тот же код необходимо выполнить не один, а несколько раз. В этом модуле мы расскажем вам о двух способах, какими это можно сделать, – рекурсии и циклах, – и немного сравним их между собой. Структуры данных – одна из обязательных составляющих любой более-менее сложной программы. В данном модуле мы познакомимся со списками --- одной из самых простых, но вместе с тем полезной структурой данных, – а также их лучшими друзьями строками и массивами. В последнем видео мы сделаем небольшой шаг в сторону и обсудим такую вещь, как функции высших порядков, – способ описывать операции над списками декларативно, – и их плюсы и минусы. К часто встречающимся структурам данных, помимо списков, относятся ассоциативные массивы и множества. В данном модуле мы обсудим то, какие возможности они предоставляют программистам и какие реальные объекты напоминают. В последнем видео мы снова сделаем отступление и поговорим про такой объект как null: что он собой представляет, почему он нужен, какие безопасные и не очень способы работы с ним есть. Для общения с пользователем в программировании могут использоваться различные механизмы, от строго заданной web-формы до разговора в свободной форме в чате. Самым простым механизмом является консольный ввод-вывод, с которым мы и познакомимся в данном модуле. Кроме непосредственно ввода-вывода мы также обсудим вопросы разбора текстовых данных и то, как в языке Котлин обрабатываются ошибки. Еще одним способом общения с внешним миром в программировании являются файлы. В этом модуле мы поговорим о том, как в языке Котлин можно работать (читать/записывать) с файлами, и попытаемся объединить все, изученное ранее, на нескольких практических примерах. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:33h:1|2;Java

We'll start the nuts and bolts how to effectively parallelize familiar collections operations, and we'll build up to parallel collections, a production-ready data parallel collections library available in the Scala standard library. Throughout, we'll apply these concepts through several hands-on examples that analyze real-world data, such as popular algorithms like k-means clustering. Learning Outcomes. By the end of this course you will be able to:  - reason about task and data parallel programs, - express common algorithms in a functional style and solve them in parallel, - competently microbenchmark parallel code, - write programs that effectively use parallel collections to achieve performance  Recommended background: You should have at least one year programming experience. Proficiency with Java or CSharp is ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript or Ruby is also sufficient. You should have some familiarity using the command line. This course is intended to be taken after Functional Program Design in Scala: https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun2. Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish We motivate parallel programming and introduce the basic constructs for building parallel programs on JVM and Scala. Examples such as array norm and Monte Carlo computations illustrate these concepts. We show how to estimate work and depth of parallel programs as well as how to benchmark the implementations. We continue with examples of parallel algorithms by presenting a parallel merge sort. We then explain how operations such as map, reduce, and scan can be computed in parallel. We present associativity as the key condition enabling parallel implementation of reduce and scan. We show how data parallel operations enable the development of elegant data-parallel code in Scala. We give an overview of the parallel collections hierarchy, including the traits of splitters and combiners that complement iterators and builders from the sequential case. We give a glimpse of the internals of data structures for parallel computing, which helps us understand what is happening under the hood of parallel collections. Discover how to write elegant code that works the first time it is run. This Specialization provides a hands-on introduction to functional programming using the widespread programming language, Scala. It begins from the basic building blocks of the functional paradigm, first showing how to use these blocks to solve small problems, before building up to combining these concepts to architect larger functional programs. You'll see how the functional paradigm facilitates parallel and distributed programming, and through a series of hands on examples and programming assignments, you'll learn how to analyze data sets small to large from parallel programming on multicore architectures, to distributed programming on a cluster using Apache Spark. A final capstone project will allow you to apply the skills you learned by building a large data-intensive application using real-world data. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:24h:1|2;Java

A modern VLSI chip is a remarkably complex beast:  billions of transistors, millions of logic gates deployed for computation and control, big blocks of memory, embedded blocks of pre-designed functions designed by third parties (called “intellectual property” or IP blocks).  How do people manage to design these complicated chips?  Answer:  a sequence of computer aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines it step-wise to a final design. This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design.  Our focus in this part of the course is on the key logical and geometric representations that make it possible to map from logic to layout, and in particular, to place, route, and evaluate the timing of large logic networks. Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures. Topics covered will include: technology mapping, timing analysis, and ASIC placement and routing.  Recommended Background: Programming experience (C, C++, Java, Python, etc.) and basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms (especially recursive algorithms).  An understanding of basic digital design:  Boolean algebra, Kmaps, gates and flip flops, finite state machine design.  Linear algebra and calculus at the level of a junior or senior in engineering.  Elementary knowledge of RC linear circuits (at the level of an introductory physics class).

Illinois serves the world by creating knowledge, preparing students for lives of impact, and finding solutions to critical societal needs.  In this module you will become familiar with the course and our learning environment. The orientation will also help you obtain the technical skills required for the course. In this second part of our course, we will talk about geometry. We will begin with an overview of the ASIC layout process, and discuss the role of technology libraries, tech mapping (a topic we delay until the following week, to let those who want to do the Placer programming assignment have more time), and placement and routing.  In this set of lectures, we focus on the placement process itself:  you have a million gates from the result of synthesis and map, so, where do they go? This process is called “placement”, and we describe an iterative method, and a mathematical optimization method, that can each do very large placement tasks. Technology Mapping!  We omitted one critical step between logic and layout, the process of translating the output of synthesis -- which is NOT real gates in your technology library -- into real logic gates. The Tech Mapper performs this important step, and it is a surprisingly elegant algorithm involving recursive covering of a tree. Another place where knowing some practical computer science comes to the rescue in VLSI CAD. Routing! You put a few million gates on the surface of the chip in some sensible way. What's next? Create the wires to connect them. We focus on Maze Routing, which is a classical and powerful technique with the virtue that one can add much sophisticated functionality on top of a rather simple core algorithm. This is also the topic for final (optional) programming assignment. Yes, if you choose, you get to route pieces of the industrial benchmarks we had you place in the placer software assignment. You synthesized it. You mapped it. You placed it. You routed it. Now what? HOW FAST DOES IT GO? Oh, we need some new models, to talk about how TIMING works. Delay through logic gates and big networks of gates. New numbers to understand: ATs, RATs, SLACKS, etc. And some electrical details (minimal) to figure out how delays happen through the physical geometry of physical routed wires. All together this is the stuff of Static Timing Analysis (STA), which is a huge and important final sign off step in real ASIC design. There is no new content this week. Instead, you should focus on finishing the last problem set and completing the Final Exam. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:46h:1|2;Algorithms

При этом акцент сделан на практических областях применения и научном анализе эффективности алгоритмов, реализованных на Java. В части I рассматриваются элементарные структуры данных, а также алгоритмы сортировки и поиска. В части II освещаются алгоритмы обработки графов и строк. Все компоненты этого курса предоставляются бесплатно. При этом по завершении не выдаются какие-либо сертификаты. Subtitles: French, Portuguese (Brazilian), Korean, Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: French, Portuguese (Brazilian), Korean, Russian, English, Spanish Princeton University is a private research university located in Princeton, New Jersey, United States. It is one of the eight universities of the Ivy League, and one of the nine Colonial Colleges founded before the American Revolution. Введение в алгоритмы, часть I. Мы демонстрируем наш базовый подход к разработке и анализу алгоритмов через рассмотрение проблемы динамической связности. Мы представляем тип данных непересекающихся множеств и рассматриваем несколько вариантов его реализации (быстрый поиск, быстрое объединение, взвешенное быстрое объединение и взвешенное быстрое объединение со сжатием пути). Наконец, мы применяем тип данных непересекающихся множеств для решения проблемы перколяции из физической химии. В основе нашего подхода к анализу эффективности алгоритмов лежит научный метод. Начнем с вычислительных экспериментов для измерения времени выполнения наших программ. Мы применяем эти измерения для формирования гипотез об эффективности. Затем мы составляем математические модели, объясняющие поведение алгоритмов. Наконец, мы рассмотрим анализ использования памяти нашими программами на Java. Мы рассмотрим два фундаментальных типа данных для хранения коллекций объектов: стек и очередь. Каждый из них реализуется с помощью односвязного списка или массива изменяющегося размера. Мы представим две продвинутые функции Java, упрощающие клиентский код: обобщенные коллекции и итераторы. Наконец, будут рассмотрены различные применения стеков и очередей, начиная от разбора арифметических выражений и заканчивая моделированием систем массового обслуживания. Мы познакомим вас с проблемой сортировки и интерфейсом Comparable Java. Мы изучим два элементарных метода сортировки (сортировку выбором и сортировку вставкой), а также разновидность одного из них — сортировку методом Шелла. Также мы рассмотрим два алгоритма для равномерного перемешивания массива. В завершение мы продемонстрируем применение сортировки на практике для вычисления выпуклой оболочки множества точек с помощью алгоритма сканирования Грэма. Мы изучим алгоритм сортировки с объединением и покажем, что он позволяет отсортировать любой массив из n элементов с максимальным количество сравнений n lg n. Также будет рассмотрена нерекурсивная версия этого алгоритма («снизу вверх»). Мы докажем, что любой алгоритм сортировки, основанный на сравнении, в худшем случае должен выполнить не менее n lg n сравнений. Мы обсудим применение различных схем упорядочения сортируемых объектов и связанную с этим концепцию устойчивости. Мы изучим и реализуем алгоритм рандомизированной быстрой сортировки и проанализируем его эффективность. Кроме того, рассмотрим рандомизированный быстрый выбор — вариант быстрой сортировки, находящий k-й наименьший элемент за линейное время. В завершение мы рассмотрим 3-направленную быструю сортировку — вариант быстрой сортировки, особенно хорошо работающий при наличии дублирующихся ключей. Мы представляем тип данных «приоритизированная очередь» и его эффективную реализацию с помощью структуры данных «бинарная куча». Эта реализация также является основой эффективного алгоритма кучевой сортировки. В завершение мы познакомимся с применением приоритизированных очередей. В частности, мы смоделируем движение объекта, состоящего из n частичек, по законам упругих столкновений. Мы зададим API для таблиц символов (также известных как ассоциативные массивы, карты или словари) и опишем две элементарные реализации с использованием отсортированного массива (бинарный поиск) и неупорядоченного списка (последовательный поиск). Если ключи имеют тип Comparable, мы зададим расширенный API, включающий дополнительные методы минимума и максимума, нижнего и верхнего предела, ранжирования и выбора. Для разработки эффективной реализации этого API мы изучим структуру данных «бинарное дерево поиска» и проанализируем ее эффективность. В этой лекции наша цель состоит в создании таблицы символов с гарантированной логарифмической эффективностью поиска и вставки (а также множества других операций). Мы начнем с рассмотрения 2-3-деревьев, которые легко анализировать, но сложно реализовать. Затем рассмотрим красно-черные бинарные деревья поиска, которые послужат новым способом реализации 2-3-деревьев в виде бинарных деревьев поиска. Наконец мы представим B-деревья — обобщение 2-3-деревьев, широко применяющееся при реализации файловых систем. Мы начнем с поиска в 1-мерных и 2-мерных диапазонах, цель которого — найти все точки в заданном 1-мерном или 2-мерном диапазоне. Для выполнения данной задачи рассмотрим k-мерные деревья — естественное обобщение БДП, ключи которого — точки на плоскости (или в пространствах более высокого порядка). Также рассмотрим проблемы пересечений, когда требуется найти все пересечения среди множества отрезков или прямоугольников. Вначале мы опишем желательные свойства хэш-функции и ее реализацию в Java, включая фундаментальное допущение о равномерности хэширования, определяющее потенциальную успешность хэширования. Затем рассмотрим две стратегии реализации хэш-таблиц — раздельное связывание цепочками и линейное исследование. Обе стратегии имеют постоянную по времени эффективность поиска и вставки при удовлетворении допущения о равномерности хэширования. Рассмотрим различные практические области применения таблиц символов, включая множества, клиенты словарей, клиенты индексирования и разреженные векторы. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:48h:1|2;Algorithms

Но что, если вы действительно хотите понять, как была создана страница? Есть отличные учебники и онлайн-ресурсы для изучения веб-дизайна, но для понимания большинства из этих ресурсов требуются некоторые базовые знания. Этот курс разработан для помощи новичкам, которые хотят обрести уверенность и новые знания.  Мы рассмотрим теорию (что на самом деле происходит, когда вы нажимаете на ссылку на веб-странице?), практику (что нужно знать, чтобы создать свою собственную страницу?) и некоторые упущенные моменты (у вас есть страница, что вам делать с ней?).  На протяжении всего курса особое внимание будет уделяться соблюдению синтаксических стандартов для валидации и семантических стандартов для обеспечения доступности веб-страницы для пользователей с ограниченными возможностями.   Учебник, который мы используем — «Недостающее звено: введение в веб-разработку и программирование» (The Missing Link: An Introduction to Web Development and Programming) Майкла Мендеса — доступен на сайте www.opensuny.org. Этот курс подойдет самым разным людям, но особенно тем, кто хотел бы получить пошаговое описание базовых вещей. Для этого курса нет обязательных требований, и предполагается, что учащиеся не имеют навыков программирования и опыта работы в сфере ИТ. Курс завершится небольшим финальным проектом, который потребует создания очень простой страницы со ссылками и изображениями. Основное внимание в этом курсе уделяется базовым вещам, а не внешнему виду. Вы можете посмотреть образец окончательной страницы по ссылке http://intro-webdesign.com/html5-plain.html.  Это первый курс специализации «Веб-дизайн для всех». Последующие курсы сосредоточены на востребованных на рынке труда навыках стилизации страницы с помощью CSS3, добавления интерактивности с помощью JavaScript и расширенной стилизации с использованием респонсивного дизайна.

На этой неделе мы раскроем «тайну» Интернета.  Что происходит, когда вы вводите URL-ссылку в свой браузер, и веб-страница волшебным образом появляется на вашем экране?  Что такое HTML5 и что случилось с HTML 1–4?  Мы также рассмотрим некоторые практические понятия, которые вам понадобится усвоить, прежде чем начать писать собственные страницы. На этой неделе вам нужно будет вдохнуть поглубже и погрузиться в написание кода.  Я расскажу о большом количестве HTML-тегов, но важно, чтобы вы практиковались, а не просто слушали это видео и читали материалы учебника.  Чтобы учиться, нужно практиковаться (и ошибаться!).     Вы не поверите, но как только вы освоите основную идею использования тегов и атрибутов, вы будете знать все, что вам нужно для использования любого тега HTML5.  Страница пока может выглядеть не так, как вы хотите, но вы уже сможете использовать текст, ссылки, изображения, таблицы и даже музыку и видео!    Если на этой неделе вам нужен будет учебник для повторения концепций, мы будем использовать онлайн-учебник Шая Хоу.   Я буду оставлять ссылки после лекций, но некоторые учащиеся предпочитают читать учебник перед видео (я предпочитаю читать, смотреть, а затем читать снова).  Хорошо, вы создали файл ... что теперь?  На этой неделе мы начнем с рассмотрения важных, но часто упускаемых из виду концепций валидации и доступности.  Следили ли вы за структурой DOM при создании страницы?  Использовали ли вы семантические теги, чтобы обеспечить доступ ко всей информации всем посетителям страницы, даже если у них есть физические или когнитивные нарушения?   Это знания, которые вы cможете использовать, если захотите продолжить карьеру в качестве специалиста по веб-доступности.  Наконец, я вкратце расскажу о шагах, необходимых для публикации вашего сайта в сети.

In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of parallel programming, from task parallelism to data parallelism. In particular, you'll see how many familiar ideas from functional programming map perfectly to to the data parallel paradigm. We'll start the nuts and bolts how to effectively parallelize familiar collections operations, and we'll build up to parallel collections, a production-ready data parallel collections library available in the Scala standard library. Throughout, we'll apply these concepts through several hands-on examples that analyze real-world data, such as popular algorithms like k-means clustering. Learning Outcomes. By the end of this course you will be able to:  - reason about task and data parallel programs, - express common algorithms in a functional style and solve them in parallel, - competently microbenchmark parallel code, - write programs that effectively use parallel collections to achieve performance  Recommended background: You should have at least one year programming experience. Proficiency with Java or CSharp is ideal, but experience with other languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript or Ruby is also sufficient. You should have some familiarity using the command line.

Examples such as array norm and Monte Carlo computations illustrate these concepts. We show how to estimate work and depth of parallel programs as well as how to benchmark the implementations. We continue with examples of parallel algorithms by presenting a parallel merge sort. We then explain how operations such as map, reduce, and scan can be computed in parallel. We present associativity as the key condition enabling parallel implementation of reduce and scan. We show how data parallel operations enable the development of elegant data-parallel code in Scala. We give an overview of the parallel collections hierarchy, including the traits of splitters and combiners that complement iterators and builders from the sequential case. We give a glimpse of the internals of data structures for parallel computing, which helps us understand what is happening under the hood of parallel collections. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:33h:1|2;Algorithms

Если не будет данных о свойствах веществ, о свойствах нуклидов, то все, даже лучшие модели, не будут хорошо описывать реальность.  Этот краткий курс посвящен ядерным данным. История освоения людьми ядерных данных начинается, фактически, с момента открытия радиоактивности. Когда мы открываем новое явление, мы хотим знать о его характеристиках. И первые данные, о которых люди задумались, были периоды полураспада, энергия распада, энергия, которая носит с собой альфа частицы при распаде того или иного изотопа. Возникали вопросы, на которые физики могли дать теоретический ответ, а потом экспериментаторы проверяли эти данные, и наоборот.   И сегодня накопилось много ядерных данных. Они сосредоточены в различных системах, и одна из таких систем — система иллюстрации ядерных данных JANIS (Java-based nuclear information software). Здесь Вы узнаете, как работать с ядерными данными с помощью этой системы иллюстрации ядерных данных JANIS.

If so, this is the place for you! This is the second course in the Coding for Designers, Managers, and Entrepreneurs Specialization. If you’re a hands-on collaborator with developers, this course is specifically designed for you. In this course, we’re going to focus on creating interactive user interfaces (UI’s) with Javascript, building creative confidence and competence that will make you an even better collaborator on digital projects.

Founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, the University is guided by his vision of discovery, innovation, and development of the full potential of students from all walks of life. Through these courses, global learners have an opportunity to study with renowned scholars and thought leaders. This week, we’re going to dive into Javascript with a focus on user interfaces. We’ll do this with a Javascript library called JQuery that provides pre-built functions we can use to control web page. As with Course 1, I’ve got a layered set of resources for you to use in getting a handle on the basics. As before, try to find a minimum that gives you comfort with the fundamentals where you can work your way through the specifics of the case. You’ve probably heard this from me before, but to debug is to code. Rather than seeing this week as a kind of exception or necessary nuisance, I hope you’ll immerse yourself in the process and mentality of analytical debugging. Personally, I’ve found that the process of analytical debugging has helped me think generally in a more disciplined and systematic way about what I’m trying to do and how I’m going to do it.  Now it’s time to take the prototype you created with HTML & CSS in Course 1 of the specialization and bring it to life with Javascript. How do you do that? Well, I think that once you figure out exactly what you want to have happen, you’ll find it’s relatively easy- so start there. Based on the user stories you selected and/or drafted, the UI comparables you reviewed, and your approach to the current prototype, what would make the interface better? More functional? Nothing will help you through your coding like a nice clear idea of what you’re trying to have happen.  Note 1: If you started here in the specialization, you’ll want to work from the options in the brief to build a prototype on JS Fiddle in HTML and CSS, and then layer in some Javascript.   Note 2: If you’d like to start with a new concept from the brief for this course, that’s fine. In this specialization, you will experience what it is to go from idea to code. These courses are specifically created for the manager, designer, or entrepreneur who is an active, hands-on collaborator with developers. By the end of the program, you will be able to build working software using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. More important, you will build your creative confidence (and competency!) on engaging in digital projects. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:15h:1|2;Web Development

Interviews with actors who appeared in the Colorado Shakespeare Festival’s 2019 production of Twelfth Night, as well as lectures by scholars and theater professionals who work and teach at the University of Colorado Boulder, offer students insight into Shakespeare’s artistic vision and its applications. Exploring Shakespeare’s language, his characters, his humor and his world view, the lectures, interviews, and interactive learning experiences that make up this class will help students comprehend the power of Shakespearean comedy and the abiding appeal of Twelfth Night for its original audience and our contemporary moment. You'll explore the relationship between comedy and tragedy, the conflict inherent in desire, and the ways Shakespeare's words and works engaged his community, and yours. This course strives to be of interest to multiple audiences, but we think it may particularly appeal to... * Shakespeare enthusiasts and the Shakespeare curious in all walks of life * Actors, theater practitioners, and teachers of Shakespeare everywhere * Secondary school and college students interested in expanding their studies of Shakespeare * Interested readers with little or no familiarity with Shakespeare Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Javanese, Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Javanese, Russian, English, Spanish CU-Boulder is a dynamic community of scholars and learners on one of the most spectacular college campuses in the country. As one of 34 U.S. public institutions in the prestigious Association of American Universities (AAU), we have a proud tradition of academic excellence, with five Nobel laureates and more than 50 members of prestigious academic academies. This module provides an overview of Twelfth Night and introduces the play by exploring key aspects of the world it imagines.  The interviews, lectures, and faculty roundtable explore the carnivalesque quality of the play, its humor, its language, and significant historical contexts.  Dialogues with scholars and theater practitioners provide multiple perspectives on the nature of this narrative universe.  This module focuses on Shakespeare’s understanding of human psychology, especially the experience of desire.  Twelfth Night dramatizes the folly associated with love, and also—as with all of Shakespeare’s comedies—revels in the tumult love creates.  The world depicted in this play is characterized by a kind of collective madness that grows ever more chaotic as it progresses. Module Three emphasizes how assumptions about social order fuel conflict in the play.  The previous module emphasized the humor that derives from desire, but also the awareness of grimmer aspects of desire.  The lectures, interviews and roundtables in this unit focus on desires that are not allowed.  Desire creates conflict.  This aspect of Twelfth Night is most obviously evident in the interactions among a number of the play’s minor characters, especially the conflict between Malvolio, on the one hand, and Sir Toby and Maria, on the other.   This module focuses on how Shakespeare’s play both conforms to the expectations of the comedic genre and challenges the genre’s conventions.  Such tensions are especially evident in the play’s resolution.  Even as the play provides the marriages expected at the end of a comedy, the play also draws attention to characters excluded from such happy endings.   Twelfth Night derives great humor from the chaos prompted by love but the conflicts unleashed in the course of the play’s action cannot all be resolved by the marriage of some members of the community.  In this module we will briefly explore a case study of how Twelfth Night has been re-interpreted and repurposed by the Colorado Shakespeare Festival’s Shakespeare in the Schools project.  Module five examines how Malvolio's story offers a platform for conversations relevant to our own day about communities and violence.  In this optional bonus module, we include for you the full-length Twelfth Night actor interviews in case you are interested in digging deeper into these discussions. Reviewing these videos isn't a course requirement, but we wanted to include them for your benefit. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:23h:1|2;Java

You’ll learn about the difference between editing and proofreading. You’ll practice “un-numbing the numbers” so that data and statistics you use are clear and compelling. And you’ll be introduced to a framework for giving and receiving feedback that helpfully systematizes what should be cut and what should be kept from each draft. As with the other three courses in this series, you will also get access to a wide range of books and other resources you can use even after you finish the course. These include: (1) the readings and exercises provided to the students who have taken the in-person version of this course at the University of Michigan and the University of Chicago (2) two digital libraries of excellent writing from a diverse collection of journalists, scientists, novelists, poets, historians, and entrepreneurs and (3) a monthly “Good Sentences” email.

This course offers learners the chance to encounter and appreciate behavior, moral standards and some of the material conditions surrounding Japanese artists in the nineteenth century, in order to renew our assumptions about what artistic “realism” is and what it meant. Learners will walk away with a clear understanding of how society and the individual were conceived of and represented in early modern Japan. Unlike contemporary western art forms, which acknowledge their common debt as “sister arts” but remain divided by genre and discourse, Japanese visual and literary culture tended to combine, producing literary texts inspired by visual images, and visual images which would then be inscribed with poems and prose. Noticing and being able to interpret this indivisibility of visual/literary cultures is essential in understanding the social and psychological values embedded within the beauty of Japanese art. Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish The University of Tokyo was established in 1877 as the first national university in Japan. As a leading research university, UTokyo offers courses in essentially all academic disciplines at both undergraduate and graduate levels and conducts research across the full spectrum of academic activity. One good way to gauge the distance between literary and visual culture in early modern Japan is to examine the ways in which painters and poets depicted their contemporaries. Portraits of samurai are especially rich in information about how men at the top of the social ladder wished to be “viewed” as physical entities, and how they expressed themselves as moral actors within society. In the first module, we will learn the basic formal aspects of samurai portraiture, and at the same time begin to interpret poems and prose inscribed onto the images themselves. Visual images of women produced in Japan before the introduction of photography can be divided into two types: portraits of women who actually existed in society, and painted or printed images of idealized “beauties,” whose resemblance to physical reality was subsumed often to an intense interest in mode and situational aspect. Like samurai portraits, images of women, both real and imagined, would often be inscribed with texts which instruct viewers how to understand and appreciate them. In this module, we will overview several painted and printed images, and learn how contemporary viewers used these images and their texts as a tool to understand the world. What methods did early modern Japanese artists and writers have at hand to “capture the moment,” and how did these methods influence the introduction and adaption of western photography in the mid-nineteenth century? In this module we will see how photographic modes of representation were assimilated into the literary tradition of portraiture, which was covered in modules 1 and 2. Our final module traces the trajectory of the literary photograph from the end of the long nineteenth century into Japan’s modern era. Photographic images of the human figure in late nineteenth and early twentieth century Japan were often accompanied by literary writing inscribed either on the image itself, or on its reverse side. Modern novelists sometimes published photographs with short poems as captions. We will wrap up our course with a summary of how visual and written modes of representation colluded, and combined to produce powerful documents of social and psychological actuality. ;10;1;1;Długość kursu:50h:1|2;Java

This course introduces you to linguistics, featuring interviews with well-known linguists and with speakers of many different languages. Join us to explore the miracles of human language! The Miracles of Human Language introduces you to the many-faceted study of languages, which has amazed humans since the beginning of history. Together with speakers of many other languages around the world, as well as with famous linguists such as Noam Chomsky and Adele Goldberg, you will learn to understand and analyse how your native tongue is at the same time similar and different from many other languages. You will learn the basic concepts of linguistics, get to know some of the key features of big and small languages and get insight into what linguists do.  This course gives an introduction into the study of languages, the field of linguistics. With the support of the basic linguistic terminology that is offered in the course, you will soon be able to comment both on variety between languages, as well as on a single language’s internal structure. Anyone who wishes to understand how languages work, and how they can give us insight into the human mind is very welcome to join.  The course is useful if you want to get a fairly quick introduction into linguistics, for instance because you are considering studying it further, or because you are interested in a neighbouring discipline such as psychology, computer science or anthropology. Furthermore, the course will help you develop analytical skills.  If you are curious to understand how language works and how it gives insight into the human mind, this course is definitely for you!

This prominent position gives our graduates a leading edge and prepares them for careers both within and outside of academia. Leiden University is the oldest university in the Netherlands, founded in 1575. Our motto is: Praesidium Libertatis (Bastion of Liberty) - Freedom of spirit, thought and expression. Leiden University has a campus in Leiden and The Hague, with 7 faculties, 47 Bachelor Programmes, 79 Master Programmes and nearly 30,000 students. In this first week, we will try to determine what makes language human: why do (almost) all human beings have a language, and what makes human language different from animal communication systems? We will furthermore discuss the many different places where linguists work, and the many different methodologies that they use for conducting their research. You will moreover get to know all the other participants in this MOOC: my students Inge and Marten, as well as the speakers of six different languages. Finally, don't forget to watch our first expert interview: Marten and Inge have talked with Dr. Victoria Nyst of Leiden University, who has enlightened us in the fascinating world of sign languages! For the assignments with the support of Ethnologue, please make sure to study the instructions listed in 'required and optional readings' of this module. In this module we will delve into what appear to be the smallest building blocks of spoken language: 'sounds'. As we will see however, all is not what it seems, as we will in fact encounter an even smaller building block of language, a true atom. Another interesting thing about this module is that as of this week our 6 informants will all only speak their own language. Naturally, there is also an interview with my very special friend Prof. dr. Claartje Levelt, whom I have announced before. In this module we will discuss words and sentences. All languages have them but as I will illustrate, they can be organized in very different ways in different languages. I will furthermore demonstrate what cupcakes have in common with words in a sentence. This module's interview is with one of the most cited and re-knowned linguists alive, Prof. Noam Chomsky! Finally, our 6 language informants will provide us with information about the word order in their languages. This module deals with a topic which many of you find very interesting: meaning. How do we determine what a word means? To what extent does our language influence our thinking? How can we change the world with language? As usual, we also have an additional interview with an expert of the current module's theme: in this module Barend Beekhuizen talks to Inge and Marten about his work as a Leiden PhD student in computational linguistics. This module features all of the well-known parts of the current MOOC. Informants tell us about speech errors in their native tongue, I discuss everyday mistakes with my students Marten and Inge, and we have an interview with Prof. Niels Schiller of Leiden University. He discusses with us his own research among others. We moreover go on a little outing, to see linguists in their natural habitat! Furthermore, thanks to our friends at 'Babel, -The Language Magazine' we have some interesting reading for you. For example, linguist Jörg Schwyter tells us all about how he had to deal with aphasia, and how that has influenced him as a multilingual speaker.  In the previous modules we have dissected the structure of languages, but now we will study language in its real context: how does language change? How do people use language to be polite? Our informants are demonstrating their acting skills, and furthermore we have an interview with Prof. Adele Goldberg! She presents us with an alternative view of language, compared to the one as previously discussed by Prof. Chomsky in the third module. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:30h:1|2;Java

This week, we take the gloves off, and the lectures cover key topics like control structures and functions. We also introduce the first programming assignment for the course, which is due at the end of the week. We have now entered the third week of R Programming, which also marks the halfway point. The lectures this week cover loop functions and the debugging tools in R. These aspects of R make R useful for both interactive work and writing longer code, and so they are commonly used in practice. This week covers how to simulate data in R, which serves as the basis for doing simulation studies. We also cover the profiler in R which lets you collect detailed information on how your R functions are running and to identify bottlenecks that can be addressed. The profiler is a key tool in helping you optimize your programs. Finally, we cover the str function, which I personally believe is the most useful function in R. ;10;1;1;Długość kursu:23h:1|2;Java

Monetary policy governs the liquidity available to the payment systems that underlie trade and finance. Smooth adjustment of liquidity can minimize instability in money and foreign exchange markets and keep inflation and growth on a secure footing. The industrial giants of China, Japan, and Korea the Southeast Asian emerging markets of Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand and the international entrepots at Hong Kong and Singapore each face unique challenges in implementing liquidity policy.    This course is for learners with some background information on monetary policy.  This advanced course will build a foundation for understanding liquidity policy implementation in the Asia-Pacific using standard economic models. The course will discuss the effects of high level discussion of a key element of national level public policy, monetary policy.  Modern monetary policy connects macroeconomic conditions and key financial market indicators. It will also analyze the way that central bank goals for macroeconomic stability will determine outcomes in interest rates and exchange rates. The rigorous theoretical foundation should also build analytical skills that might be applied to policy and market analysis in a broad range of economies and even in the Asia-Pacific region as policy-making evolves in the future.  The topics covered each week:  Module 1 - Monetary Policy Implementation Module 2 - Monetary Policy Strategy Module 3 - Exchange Rates and Monetary Policy  After taking this course and going through the interactive activities, you will be able to:  (1)  Describe Monetary Policy instruments central banks use (2)  Interpret on-going actions of central banks (3)  Apply graphical analysis and calculate basic economic measures used as tools by central banks or analysts (4)  Analyze the way that central bank goals for macroeconomic stability will determine outcomes in interest rates and exchange rates Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish HKUST - A dynamic, international research university, in relentless pursuit of excellence, leading the advance of science and technology, and educating the new generation of front-runners for Asia and the world.

You will learn about concepts of landscape in Asian religions, philosophy, social sciences, history and the arts and their reverberation in selected environmental projects in China, India and Japan. Furthermore, we will discuss how they are critically reflected upon in the context of the environmental humanities, and observe how an interdisciplinary approach towards regional ecosystems past and present reaches out beyond pragmatic technological solutions to mitigate environmental damage. Following us on our different paths and trajectories through the five modules of the course, you will encounter many of the reasons why environmental humanities study projects which strive to change people’s prevalent attitudes, values and behavioural patterns in order to redeem the rapidly globalizing crisis, and how they go about it.  Having acquainted yourself with the stories Asia’s landscapes – and landscape representations – tell about actual and possible human-nature relationships, you can compare and evaluate their potential to bring about the desired change and define your own range of actions as an informed stakeholder for creating a sustainable future. What is arguably no less intriguing: you will learn how to appreciate a broad range of eco-aesthetic forms that re-enchant our lives by creatively interacting with the more-than-human world.  You can follow the five modules of the course consecutively or just study the modules that interest you the most. If you want to earn a certificate, you need to complete all of the modules including the quizzes at the end of each module.  THESE ARE THE TOPICS OF THE 5 MODULES OF THIS COURSE:  Module 1: Concepts of landscape past and present and their cosmological underpinnings.  Module 2: Entangled landscapes comprising cultural flows of concepts and forms, contemporary gardens on the move, nostalgic elegies of demolished sites and rural reconstruction projects.  Module 3: Discussion of two religious communities in India (the Parsi-Zoroastrians and the Auroville community) and their relationship with the environment.  Module 4: Environmental debates tackling religious concepts and social practices and the problem of waste disposal in India.  Module 5: Environmental movements and the impact of Fukushima on attitudes towards nuclear energy in Japan, creative activism including arts projects and documentaries to protest against pollution and landscape degradation and raise environmental awareness in the Sinosphere, and emergent concepts for sustainable community life on the planet. Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Chinese (Simplified), Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Chinese (Simplified), Russian, English, Spanish Founded in 1833, the University of Zurich (UZH) is Switzerland’s largest university, with a cur­rent enrollment of over 26,000 students. Made up of seven faculties covering approximately 100 different subject areas, UZH is proud to offer the most comprehensive aca­demic program in the country. We will begin this course by tracing historical ways of thinking about the environment in China. Through a range of examples, traditional notions of “nature” and “landscape“ will be introduced. These will be compared with modern transcultural and Western concepts. After studying a selection of key concepts pertaining to the construction of landscape (shanshui) as an aesthetic category, we will visit two sites in Switzerland where ancient and modern landscape art works from China are collected and made accessible to a wider public. Finally, we will look more closely into one historically and culturally formative theme in Chinese eco-aesthetic practice, namely the representation of human bodies as landscapes and vice versa. We will argue that the tradition of imagining, and mapping, bodies as structurally and materially embedded in the cosmic body has inspired ancient and modern artists to reflect critically upon the place and role of human beings in the world at large. Having assessed China’s ancient and modern conceptions of landscapes, and how they moved between cultures, social groups and societies, we will turn to the concept of entangled landscapes in the second module. Here, we will evaluate representations and narratives that explore the agency, conundrums and possibilities of applied transcultural aesthetic (and functional) paradigms in national politics of garden and park design. In a first step, the traveling concept of the Chinese garden will help us to evaluate the cultural and geopolitical affordances of gardens between Asia and Europe that are very often intimately connected to utopian visions of the ideal community. Next, we will encounter two different examples of a Chinese garden that bespeak their original sociopolitical functionality and conceptual underpinnings as much as the changes of these same when travelling across time and space. Our third theme of hometown nostalgia will study the turn of artists and intellectuals towards imaginary gardens of the past in view of large-scale heritage demolition in China. Finally, we will probe into the history of rural reconstruction and encounter two successful approaches towards the re-/creation of sustainable landscapes. When actually implemented in experimental contexts, utopian ideas and projects draw on alternative visions of human interaction with (existing or imaginary) landscapes. Auroville, for example, is a project based on the foundations of Sri Aurobindo's philosophy of religion. The community was established in 1968 next to the Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry (Tamil Nadu, India) by Mira Alfassa, one of the closest disciples of Sri Aurobindo. In that same year, Auroville was declared a project in congruence with the targets and ideals of UNESCO, who aims “to bring together in close juxtaposition the values and ideals of different civilizations and cultures …”. Both UNESCO and the Indian State officially support Auroville. Moreover, architects across the globe participated in the construction of, and were inspired by the social and ecological visions that characterize Auroville. When exploring this community's approach to landscape and ecology, we will tackle the underlying historical legacies and connectivities between India and Europe and listen to cultural voices engaging with the experiment. In a similar vein, religious practice is intimately connected with the particular features of regional topographies, landscapes and ecologies. For example, Zoroastric rituals in Mumbai were linked to the local population of vultures. The practical consequences of the extinction of the latter will be analysed in a next step, thematizing death and the spiritual/ritual processes that accompany the “natural“ transformation of living bodies into matter. While studying the Zoroastrian community in Mumbai, we will take a close look at the question of how their rituals are adapted to changing environmental conditions.  Waste and its disposal is another important issue heavily impacting on landscapes and their local inhabitants. It challenges conventional political approaches, mobilises the public/private spheres, and can inspire pathbreaking scientific and social experiments as well as innovative literary, arts and design projects. High rates of economic growth are radically transforming Indian society and the Indian environment. The winners in this process have attained middle class status, and live increasingly consumerist lifestyles. However, growth has also produced losers: millions have lost their land and livelihoods to expanding mining concerns in the forests of central India, and to sprawling real estate developments in and around urban centres. Moreover, domestic and industrial waste, input intensive agriculture, and growing traffic have all radically undermined the quality of both urban and rural environments. We will examine the contradictions and the limitations inherent in contemporary forms of ‘bourgeois environmentalism’, but also critically assess the suggestion that civil society and environmental concerns are indeed the preserve of ‘bourgeois’ elites.  In the last module of this course, we will look at how, in the age of the Anthropocene, the role of humans came to be conceptualized in opposition to nature, and assert the validity of certain traditional Asian ideas suggesting that we are not at the centre, nor in control of the environment. Furthermore, we will examine some of the ways in which the natural world has been “remade” within the planetary scope both discursively and materially - for instance, by way of a largely materialistic concept of historical progress encouraging industrialized resource extraction, colonial patterns of wealth accumulation, and unsustainable models of economic growth - which led to the transformation of entire ecosystems. We will moreover explore how political and economic stakeholders, activists and intellectuals in Asia get productively involved with these processes. ;10;1;1;Długość kursu:2h:1|2;Java

We are all excited to have you in this course and looking forward to providing you with further understanding about Taiwan. This course is not only about law, but also includes the context of Taiwan’s development and transformation. Therefore, you would learn the legal system as well as its evolvement in Taiwan.  Besides from the lectures, there would also be a quiz for each week and a final exam when you finished this course. These exams are designed for your self-evaluation and are for your better understanding about what you have learned from the course.       We hope you enjoy this wonderful and fruitful journey. This is the first class of Taiwan Law in Focus. In this class, we will discuss the historical developments and structural transformations of Taiwan laws. Due to the limit of time, the goal is not to provide a throughout introduction of Taiwan’s legal history. Rather, the focuses are: (1) how the characteristics of current Taiwan law came into being through waves of legal transplants since the 17th century, (2) how the people living in Taiwan encountered and experienced these regime changes and legal reforms, and (3) how Taiwan gradually, sometimes in a roundabout way, evolved from into a liberal and democratic country over the past 100 years. This is the second class of Taiwan Law in Focus. In this class, we will introduce the government structure in Taiwan and discuss how Taiwan completed its democratic transition. The other focus in this class is the constitutional court of Taiwan. Although Taiwan is not the only jurisdiction which has separate constitutional court, it enjoys some special features than others.  Let's explore the interesting and profound process of democratic transformation in Taiwan. Welcome to the third class of the course. This class will introduce you to basic knowledge and features of the Civil Law in Taiwan.  Also, you will learn the difference between civil law, constitutional law and criminal law.  Next, the course will provide you with what revision the Civil Code has experienced with the social change in Taiwan. You can learn what kinds of rights civil law provides in this lecture. And we will discuss a special issue in Taiwan -- the illegal buildings. In the end, this lecture will give you an introduction to the aging society in Taiwan and how it affects the family law and its practice. This is the fourth class of Taiwan Law in Focus. In this class, we will discuss the development of human rights laws in Taiwan, focusing on constitutional laws and interpretations. Since the end of authoritarian era in the late 1980s, the guarantees of human rights in Taiwan have been substantially implemented and strengthened. Taiwan’s civil society and Constitutional Court have served crucial roles in this process. Their crucial roles as well as other contextual dynamics will be our primary discussions in the class. Welcome to the fifth class of this course.  This class I will introduce to you the criminal justice system in Taiwan.  You will learn about the right to liberty and personal security, the right to judicial remedy, the right to silence, the right to counsel, and the right to a fair trial, under Taiwan’s Constitution. In addition, I will also give you an overview of Taiwan’s recent judicial reform of the death penalty and lay participation. This class introduces the economic development pattern and characteristics of corporate governance in Taiwan. It starts with the characteristics of Taiwan’s economic and financial development and focuses on banking markets and capital markets. On that basis, it discusses the famous corporate objective debate and corporate power structure debate in corporate laws, analyzing how Taiwan’s corporate laws address these debates and the rationale behind such designs. It then uses two specific corporate law designs, i.e. independent directors and the Investor Protection Center, as examples to illustrate the special corporate governance environment in Taiwan. The class is concluded with a forward-looking remark, which envisages how the rise of institutional investors might affect the corporate governance landscape in Taiwan in the future. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:41h:1|2;Java

In this course you will learn the different stages of clinical development as well as the regulatory including but not limited to, an Investigational New Drug Application (IND), New Drug Application (NDA), and product labeling.  Additionally you will learn how to Incorporate study design methods for consideration in the design of clinical protocols to assess safety, tolerability, and efficacy in multiple therapeutic areas.  In this course you will learn the different phases of clinical development:  * Phase 1 or early stage clinical trial are conducted primar­ily to determine how the new drug works in humans, its safety profile and to predict its dosage range.  It typically involves between 30 and 100 healthy volunteers.  * Phase 2 or Proof of Concept POC studies test for efficacy as well as safety and side effects in a group of between 30  to 200 hundred  patients with  the disease for which the new drug is being developed.  * Phase 3 or late stage clinical development involve much larger group of patients, between a few hundred to thousands, depending on the indication, which will  help  determine if the new drug can be considered both safe and effective.  It will involve control groups using placebo and/or current treatment as a comparison.  * Product registration and approval process after a drug is considered safe and effective from Phase 3 trials, it must be authorized in each individual country before  it can  be  marketed. All data gen­erated about the small molecule or biologic is collected  and  submitted to the regulatory authorities in the US at the FDA, Food and Drug Administration FDA, in Europe the EMA or European Medicines Agency, Japan Ministry of Health and other countries which may require their own national  approvals.

Did you know that in the year of 2000 there were more than 15 000 particle accelerators in the world? Yet, today it has grown to more than 30 000 of them! A third of the particle accelerators are dedicated to medical applications, such as radio therapy, and a half are used for ion implantation in semiconductor devices. Also numerous particle accelerators are used for sterilizing food. Despite these everyday life examples of small particle accelerators, it is the large accelerators, like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, that most people associate with particle accelerators. There will be many new applications for particle accelerators in the future and by that there is a need for MOOCs that describe the techniques and applications of these machines..  The NPAP series of MOOCs consists of three MOOCs designed to disseminate knowledge about particle accelerator technology to impacted fields. The courses have been made possible thanks to the support of the Erasmus Plus, Strategic Partnership funding of the European Commission and thanks to the dedicated lecturers from the universities of Lund, Uppsala, Arhus, Oslo and Jyväskylä, and by experts from the MAX IV Laboratory and European Spallation Source (ESS), both in Lund, Sweden.   In many of the lectures we detail the MAX IV Laboratory and ESS - currently hosting the most powerful synchrotron light source and neutron source in the world.  In the MAX IV Laboratory intense X-ray beams are produced by electrons that are first accelerated to almost the speed of light, and at ESS protons will be accelerated and, by a process called spallation, generate intense beams of neutron. The X-ray and neutron beams are used for looking into matter, down to the atomic level. The MAX IV Laboratory and ESS form a unique European center of excellence for thousands of scientists that together build the world of tomorrow. We also take a closer look at the Large Hadron Collider, at CERN, in Geneva. This powerful machine has already had an immense impact on theoretical physics and will continue to contribute to our knowledge of nature for quite some time.   The first course in our NPAP series is the Introduction to Particle Accelerators. It explains how a particle accelerator can  generate light of wavelengths down to one Angstrom. It also explains how the ESS facility can create a massive flux of neutrons by accelerating protons and let them smash  into a disk of tungsten. The initial modules provide the basic knowledge about linear and circular accelerators that is required to understand other types of accelerators, like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), at CERN in Geneva. We describe LHC and give an introduction to the elementary particle physics it is used for. We continue by describing some new concepts for future particle accelerators, like  plasma driven accelerators.  The second MOOC in the series is called Fundamentals of Particle Accelerator Technology (NPAP MOOC) and offers four modules: The Radio Frequency (RF) System of Accelerators Magnet technology for accelerator  Beam Diagnostics Basics of Vacuum techniques.  The third MOOC is - Medical Applications of Particle Accelerators, which offers the four modules: Introduction to the course and radiotherapy  Linear electron accelerators for radiotherapy Proton therapy part I Proton therapy part  II and the production of medical radionuclides.  The three MOOCs can be taken either separately or as a package. For students that intend to take all three courses we recommend that they are taken in order.    Get started and join us on this journey through the world of particle accelerators and be amazed by their importance for our lives and societies!  Best Regards,  The NPAP Team!

In addition, International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics (IIIEE) is part of the university and works to advance strategies for sustainable solutions through cutting edge interdisciplinary research, high-quality innovative education, and effective communication and strong partnerships. This module is about photon light sources. In particular it describes how electromagnetic radiation is produced in particle accelerators. The wavelengths of the radiation that is created in accelerators range from several meters down to a few angstrom. These electromagnetic waves help us to develop new materials and drugs, and also to reveal the inner structures of objects. This module explains how electromagnetic radiation can be created by accelerating particles and the different characteristics inherited. After a brief history of the discovery of synchrotron radiation the module focuses on the characteristics of synchrotron radiation and its features. The second part describes the magnetic devices that make electrons radiate light, while the third and last part is about Free Electron Lasers, a new type of light source that generates very coherent radiation. This module is about particle accelerators that create neutrons. It first describes how protons, or heavy ions, with large kinetic energies create neutrons as they are smashed into the nucleuses of heavy atoms, a process called spallation. It then discusses how the neutrons created in the spallation process can be used to reveal the atomic structures of materials and the inner structures of objects. The second part of the module gives a detailed description the European Spallation Source (ESS), located in Lund, Sweden. In particular it describes the different parts of the 600 meter long linear accelerator of ESS that accelerates protons to large kinetic energies.  This module describes particle colliders and explains why we need them. After a brief history of colliders it focuses on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is the world’s largest collider. This is followed by two lectures on linear colliders, exemplified by two proposed electron-positron colliders, CLIC and ILC. Finally the module discusses different options for the next generation of circular colliders.  We are constantly working on sharing more knowledge and fun resources with all of you! As such, we have created this module as a platform for more exciting new knowledge and materials that will be added to this course in the future as fun extra curricular activity! Notifications will be sent out to registered learners when we launch these updates, so stay tuned and keep an eye out for these updates in the future! ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:32h:1|2;Java

Pourtant, beaucoup d’entre elles semblent peu fiables voire volontairement mensongères, comme les fake news. Ainsi, même si nous n’avons jamais été aussi bien informés qu’avec Internet et les réseaux sociaux, la société fait paradoxalement face à un phénomène de désinformation. Comment exercer son esprit critique dans ce contexte et pour quels enjeux ? Pourquoi les fake news et les théories complotistes peuvent-elles nous apparaître séduisantes ?  Tout au long de ce cours constitué de vidéos, d’interventions d’expert-es et d’activités variées, vous allez appréhender le phénomène de désinformation, en comprendre les ressorts et les manières de le contrer. Une première étape du cours sera d’identifier les divers biais cognitifs qui nuisent au raisonnement critique et à les reconnaître dans vos propres jugements. Puis, vous analyserez la diffusion des fake news : comment circulent-elles ? Quels sont leurs impacts sur le plan individuel et collectif ?   En termes de compétences vous apprendrez des stratégies pour reconnaître les fausses informations et trouver des sources fiables. Vous analyserez le mécanisme cognitif de flexibilité cognitive, et enfin, vous apprendrez des stratégies concrètes afin de développer votre vigilance informationnelle.

Nous sommes en permanence entourés par une multitude d'informations dont la fiabilité n'est pas toujours avérée. Internet nous offre un accès quasi illimité à l'information mais paradoxalement, cela génère un phénomène de désinformation. Cette semaine, vous examinerez ce phénomène et identifierez ces ressorts. Puis, pour faire face à ce phénomène, vous aborderez la question de la production des connaissances. Vous verrez les critères caractérisant les connaissances et les distinguant d'autres types de représentations sociales et individuelles et vous aborderez le concept de vigilance épistémique.  Vous avez constaté que les fausses informations nous apparaissent séduisantes. Mais pourquoi exercer son esprit critique dans ce contexte est si difficile ? Une explication est que nous sommes sujets à de nombreux biais cognitifs, des raccourcis de pensée bien souvent efficaces mais qui peuvent aussi être à l'origine de notre manque de rationalité. Dans ce module, vous allez appréhender cette notion de biais cognitifs et identifier plusieurs de ces biais, qualifiés de biais de jugement.   Après s'être intéressés à des biais de jugement, vous analyserez, cette semaine, des biais de raisonnement. Vous allez apprendre, d'une part, à reconnaître les effets de ces biais de raisonnement dans notre vie quotidienne, et d'autre part, à identifier leurs mécanismes sous-jacent.  Après avoir caractérisé le phénomène de fausses informations et les raisons pour lesquelles elles nous séduisent, vous analyserez, cette semaine, comment se diffusent les fausses informations. Quel est le circuit d'information des fake news ? Quelles sont leurs impacts ? Cette semaine vous questionnerez un mécanisme cognitif général susceptible d'aider à ne pas croire aux fausses informations. Il s'agit du mécanisme de flexibilité cognitive. Comment le caractériser ? Quel est son lien avec l'esprit critique ?    Afin de se prémunir de ses biais cognitifs et de sa rationalité limitée, on peut s'appuyer sur des méthodes. Cette semaine, vous allez aborder deux méthodes : la méthode historiographique et la méthode expérimentale.  Sur internet, il faut donc adopter une vigilance informationnelle afin de démêler le vrai du faux.

In this course we examine the origins of homeland security and its connection with cybersecurity. Homeland security is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction. Catastrophic destruction comes in two forms: natural and man-made. For most of history the man-made variety came in the form of warfare and required the combined resources of a nation state. All that changed March 20th, 1995. On that date, members of a quasi-religious cult in Japan attacked the Tokyo subway system using Sarin gas. It was the first deployment of a weapon of mass destruction my a non-state actor. The power of destruction once reserved to nation states was now available to small groups, even individuals. The incident was a wake up call for governments around the world. Defense establishments designed to keep rogue states in check were practically useless against non-state actors. Overnight, the number of potential enemies multiplied a hundred, maybe even a thousand-fold. In response to the Tokyo Subway Attacks, the United States took measures to protect itself from WMD attack by non-state actors. Those measures were still being enacted when the nation was attacked on 9/11. On September 11, 2001, nineteen hijackers inflicted as much damage as the Imperial Japanese Navy on December 7, 1941. The investigating 9/11 Commission noted the attacks for their surpassing disproportion. The hijackers had achieved WMD effects without using WMD. They did this by subverting the nation's transportation infrastructure, turning passenger jets into guided missiles. Again, the security implications were profound. Non-state actors seeking to inflict domestic catastrophic destruction did not need to import, fabricate, or acquire WMD as the nation was surrounded by the means of its own destruction in the form of critical infrastructure. The vulnerability of critical infrastructure had not gone unnoticed. Again, in response to the Tokyo Subway attacks, which themselves had been an attack on Japanese infrastructure, President Clinton in 1996 commissioned a panel to investigate the threat to United States' infrastructure. The panel replied in 1997 that there was no immediate threat to US infrastructure, but they were concerned with the growing risk of cyber attack. The same cyber physical systems that fueled the explosive growth of the Internet were being incorporated into Industrial Control Systems that underpinned much of the nation's critical infrastructure. The panel noted that the knowledge and skills necessary to mount a cyber attack on the nation's infrastructure was growing. As a result of this observation, President Clinton in 1998 ordered the protection of US critical infrastructure, especially from cyber attack. Following 9/11, critical infrastructure protection and cybersecurity were designated core missions in the 2002 Homeland Security Act establishing the new Department of Homeland Security. They remain core missions to this day, but many don't see the connection. The connection is this: cybersecurity is essential to critical infrastructure protection, which is essential to homeland security, which is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction.  I look forward to working with you in the coming lessons.  Best wishes and good luck!

Homeland security is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction. Domestic catastrophic destruction comes in two forms: natural and manmade. For most of history, the manmade variety came in the form of warfare and required the combined resources of a nation state. In this module we examine two pivotal incidents that changed that calculus, and demonstrated how destruction once reserved to the power of nation states was wrested by non-state actors.  This module tackles the question what is homeland security, and offers a working definition to help guide the student to understanding. It also looks at the mission of the Department of Homeland Security as it relates to Safeguarding the United States from Domestic Catastrophic Destruction. Also included in this module is course exam #1. Good luck! Manmade domestic catastrophic destruction comes in two known forms: 1) weapons of mass destruction, and 2) subverting critical infrastructure. This module looks at the nation's overall strategy for countering WMD, and protecting critical infrastructure.  As stated previously, homeland security is connected to cybersecurity through critical infrastructure protection.  How this insight came about and what is meant by cybersecurity are the focus of attention in this module. Also included in this module is course exam #2 and related project assignment. Good luck! Homeland security is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction. Cybersecurity has emerged as a priority homeland security concern because a coordinated cyber attack against critical infrastructure could result in the worst catastrophe in the nation’s history. This specialization examines the cybersecurity problem, and takes a close look at what is being done to safeguard the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction by cyber attack. At the conclusion of this course, we hope learners grasp the central message that cybersecurity is essential to critical infrastructure protection, which is essential to homeland security, which is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:25h:1|2;Java

This course is designed to help an investor, businessperson or economist approach macroeconomic, institutional and international data and derive information from the indicators that point to the types of opportunities and risks that they present.  Students will gain practice by handling the data of some of the largest economies in the world –the United States, Japan, the European Union, China and India—and “reading the story” of their economies from their data, yielding surprisingly profound conclusions about their present and future. The course is the third in a series for the specialization but it is also a stand-alone course for anyone who wants practice in practical macroeconomics. This course includes 4 modules, each one deep-diving into the macroeconomic circumstances that have been brought up in the recent history of four key regions: the USA, Japan, Europe, and China and India.  Students will analyze the ways in which international economies relate with one another, the benefits of trade and migration and economic development and how it occurs, among other themes.    Professor Allard takes overarching macroeconomic theory and turns it into a practical tool for those interested in the opportunities and risks of investment and doing business in each of the four regions covered. Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish IE Business School is an internationally recognized business school where the leaders of tomorrow shape their ideas and learn to become global citizens. For over 40 years, IE Business School has promoted innovation and change in organizations, equipping managers with an entrepreneurial mindset that generates employment, wealth, and social well-being.  Regularly featured among the top business schools in the world, IE Business School has an urban campus in Madrid and a faculty of more than 400 professors who teach students from approximately 90 countries in its undergraduate and master programs. IE uses innovative online, face-to-face, and blended learning formats, including the IE Communities Platform where knowledge and experiences are exchanged with over 50,000 IE graduates that currently hold management positions in more than 100 countries worldwide.  The US economy is not only the world´s largest, but also one of the most free-market developed economies and its data is abundant and excellent.  It provides an ideal opportunity for students to review the basic macroeconomic and policy variables and relationships, and to identify these or detect their absence in the real world.  In the process, they can make the first steps toward determining how “normal” or especially good situations provide business opportunities and how departures from the rules point up situations that are risky for businesses operating in that country.  Japan, also one of the world´s giants, has followed a particular growth and development strategy which is reflected in its macroeconomic and international data.  We will explore in this segment Japan´s data, in contrast to the United States, and find the unique policy challenges that this strategy presents for Japan, and the opportunities and risks that it implies for investors.  The EU is the world´s largest trading area and if it were a country, it would be one of the world´s largest.  European nations opted for an intense project of economic integration in the postwar period which has incorporated 28 nations, but one of them, the UK, is in the process of leaving.  We will discuss in this section how this type of integration conditions growth, crisis and recovery, and the mechanisms that countries with a single monetary policy and a single currency have (and do not have) to adjust their economies.  What did we learn from the Eurozone crisis and the vote by so many UK citizens to leave Europe, and what are the implications for businesses operating in this region? The final segment of the course turns toward the two emerging giants, India and China, and contemplates their past and future development strategies and thee risks and opportunities that they entail.  Development itself is discussed, and how it occurs, and the strategies that nations may choose.  The different components of GDP (C, I, G and X-M) are compared between India and China over a long period, to see what have been the different drivers for growth in the two countries over time. Special attention is paid in this section to institutional indicators, which are very different from developed countries, and the divergent demographic trends in the two countries and the implications of those differences for the future. This Specialization aims to make economic concepts accessible to every learner, and to teach them to analyze current events using the toolkit of economics. It begins by explaining the basic parameters of the macroeconomy, and how governments can/should use both fiscal and monetary policy to influence growth, inflation and employment. It then moves on to the international arena, where countries interact, and explains the basic principles of free trade, exchange rates, the balance of payments and immigration and how these interactions affect our everyday lives. Finally, learners will apply these tools and concepts to the world's leading economies and discover how they can read from a country's economic data important lessons about the risks and opportunities of doing business in these countries, equipping them with tools that they can use in the workplace and even in their personal investment decisions. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:15h:1|2;Java

Dans les médias, la philanthropie est incarnée aujourd’hui par les milliardaires américains Bill Gates et Warren Buffet qui ont donné une grande part de leur fortune à une fondation en faveur de la santé et de l’éducation. Mais cette vision est partielle : la philanthropie est très active dans la plupart des régions du monde, pas seulement aux Etats-Unis, et ce ne sont pas seulement les très riches qui donnent, puisque de nombreux particuliers et entreprises s’impliquent.  En ce début de XXIe siècle marqué par les crises économiques et politiques, la philanthropie joue un rôle croissant pour répondre aux grands défis de notre temps. Alternative au modèle marchand et à la redistribution publique via l’impôt, le don privé est activement recherché pour financer la lutte contre la pauvreté, l’éducation, la recherche médicale ou la culture… Partout dans le monde, les fondations se multiplient, les dons se développent et influencent la vie de très nombreuses personnes. Les besoins sont immenses et la concurrence pour trouver des fonds n’a jamais été aussi vive.   Malgré son importance, la philanthropie reste mal connue notamment en France et en Europe. Plusieurs questions clés restent en suspens : De quoi parle-t-on exactement ? Qu’est-ce qui motive les philanthropes et favorise leur action ? Quelles sont les différentes façons d’agir en philanthropie ? Quel est son impact et comment l’évaluer? L’objectif de ce MOOC est de répondre à ces quatre grandes questions, en mobilisant les dernières avancées en matière de recherche et le point de vue d’experts reconnus dans leur domaine.   Que vous soyez simplement curieux de découvrir le sujet, déjà donateur ou engagé dans une démarche philanthropique, ou un professionnel qui accompagne ou sollicite des philanthropes, ce MOOC est fait pour vous ! Chaque semaine, vous progresserez grâce à des vidéos alliant théorie et pratique, des lectures pour aller plus loin, des quiz pour renforcer vos acquis et des forums où vous pourrez échanger entre participants et avec l’équipe pédagogique. A l’issue de ce MOOC, vous aurez toutes les clés en main pour comprendre et agir en faveur d’un monde meilleur !  Ce MOOC est réalisé par la chaire Philanthropie de l’ESSEC, en collaboration avec la Fondation de France.   La chaire Philanthropie de l’ESSEC bénéficie du soutien de la Fondation de France, de la Fondation Daniel & Nina Carasso, des Fondations Edmond de Rothschild, de la Fondation Bettencourt Schueller et de la Fondation Caritas France. Subtitles: French Subtitles: French For over a century, ESSEC has been developing a state-of-the-art educational program that gives the individual pride of place in its learning model, promoting the values of freedom, openness, innovation and responsibility. Preparing future managers to reconcile personal interests with collective responsibility, giving consideration to the common good in their decision-making, and weighing economic challenges against the social costs are some of the objectives ESSEC has set for itself. Its ultimate goal? To create a global world that has meaning for us all. Ce premier module donne toutes les clés pour comprendre ce qu’est la philanthropie. Vous apprendrez ce que signifie ce mot et comment son sens a évolué au fil du temps. Vous voyagerez dans l’histoire de la philanthropie de l’Antiquité à nos jours, à travers l’exemple de la France. Vous découvrirez les chiffres-clés et le marché de la collecte de fonds aujourd’hui. Vous comprendrez l’environnement juridique et fiscal dans lequel la philanthropie se pratique. Enfin, vous participerez aux grands débats sur le rôle de la philanthropie et ses rapports avec l’Etat et le capitalisme. Dans ce module, nous explorerons les derniers résultats de la recherche en psychologie, en économie, en sociologie et même en neurosciences pour dresser le “portrait-robot” de ceux qui donnent, mais aussi pour découvrir les 7 grandes familles de motivations philanthropiques : l’altruisme, le plaisir de donner, le calcul coûts-bénéfices, la recherche d’efficacité, la réputation, la réciprocité et l’obligation morale. A l’issue de ce module, vous aurez une compréhension très fine des mécanismes du don et découvrirez donc ce qui motive la philanthropie. Ce troisième module vous propose de répondre à l’épineuse question de “comment donner ?” Cette réflexion stratégique est cruciale pour les grands donateurs, les entreprises et les fondations, qui doivent choisir parmi une myriade de possibilités et assumer leurs choix. Comment définir les objectifs d’une initiative philanthropique ? Comment tracer le chemin pour atteindre ces objectifs ? Comment formuler une stratégie philanthropique ? Quels sont les grands dilemmes auxquels sont confrontés les philanthropes ? Nous évoquerons également quelques pratiques innovantes qui viennent bousculer la philanthropie traditionnelle. Ce module intéressera bien sûr les financeurs mais aussi tous ceux qui interagissent avec eux. Avec le dernier module de ce MOOC, nous nous intéressons aux conséquences de la philanthropie. Car aussi bonnes que soient nos intentions, toute action philanthropique n’est pas obligatoirement synonyme de changement positif pour les bénéficiaires ou les causes soutenues. Ce module vous propose de réfléchir aux questions suivantes : Quels sont les effets de la philanthropie sur ses parties prenantes ? Pourquoi est-ce important d’y prêter attention ? Qu’est-ce que la notion d’impact (social) de la philanthropie ? Comment s’y prendre pour l’évaluer ? A l’issue de ce module, vous aurez un cadre méthodologique précis et des pistes concrètes pour y répondre par vous-mêmes. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:34h:1|2;Java

Educating nearly 468,000 students in more than 7,500 degree and certificate programs both on campus and online, SUNY has nearly 3 million alumni around the globe. The goal of the Module is to define individual skills management, examine its theoretical foundations, and clarify its crucial role for career success in a highly competitive job market. We derive some useful lessons from business strategy in particular, we examine how business strategists  measure and manage “competitive advantage”, so that you can use a similar approach for crafting effective personal strategies in the job market. Then, we discuss the desired outcomes of individual skills management training. For this purpose, we review the Individual Skills Management Framework. (At the end of the course, you’ll be able to check your progress against the Framework).  In this Module, we move to discussing practical approaches, models, and tools that you can use for measuring and managing your skills in a competitive job market environment. First, we discuss how to operationalize skills (in other words, how to make them measurable). Then, we examine how to cluster skills into job-specific skillsets and use performance management techniques to objectively evaluate the level of mastery. Finally, using a simulated competitive job selection process, we will show how to realistically estimate your total skillset score.  In the Module, we also introduce “J.A.F.A.R., The Skills Manager Pro (TM)”, a free and intuitive individual skills management software developed for this course. In addition to organizing skill-building routines, J.A.F.A.R. will help you achieve tangible outcomes that can be immediately useful for your next job application. Now, it is time to put individual skills management to work and explore how you can implement the methods and techniques introduced in the course in typical skill-building scenarios. In this and the following Modules, we examine two case studies dealing with three career enhancement scenarios, namely Job Excellence, Job Enhancement, and Job Diversification. We also demonstrate how to use Jafar, the skills management application, for producing tangible outcomes for your ongoing professional development and your next job application. In Module 3, we begin by demonstrating how to identify, quantify, and objectively evaluate a job-specific skillset. Then, we will focus on generating a powerful and informative Selection Criteria Statement. We will also discuss how you can significantly improve your next job application by making it job-specific, evidence-based, data-driven, and externally-verified.   In Module 4, we examine another case study focusing on the Job Diversification scenario. According to the latest job market research, in the modern economy it is becoming an absolute necessity to have a second vocational area of expertise (www.burningglass.com). That’s why we will explore a case in which a career builder strives to extend his job search area by adding a new skill in a different occupational field. You will learn how to use skills management methods and techniques to guide you through the entry process by identifying the training needs and designing concrete targets for effective professional development. Are you ready to give it a try? In this Module, we’ll ask you to download a blank Jafar template and populate it with real-life data for your current job or (even better!) your next career move. By now, you should be able to implement the skills managements methods and techniques that we discussed in the course and produce an accurate skillset review and obtain meaningful tangible outcomes that are useful for both your job selection (or promotion) process, as well as ongoing professional development. This final project is not a small undertaking, please allow sufficient time. In the end, we will ask you to submit your results for peer review. You will also evaluate the work of your peers. Please promptly provide constructive and fair developmental feedback, as it adds extra value to the course. It’s time to wrap it up! When developing the course, we wanted to fill a certain void. While there are thousands of online courses offering career builders numerous opportunities for learning new skills, there are very few courses teaching people how to effectively measure and manage their skills. Most people even do not know that their skills are already being sorted out and quantified by computerized recruiting systems powered by artificial intelligence. We think that upon completion of the course, you should be able to objectively measure your skills and more effectively organize, develop, and present them in a skill-based, job selection process. In the last Module, we want you to test your knowledge, evaluate your progress against the Individual Skills Management Framework, and boost confidence in your ability to get skilled.  ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:20h:1|2;Java

Nous allons dans cet épisode commencer à entrer dans le cœur des spécificités des mutuelles : quel statut juridique et quelle gouvernance ? Quel modèle économique ? Quelle approche du métier ? Autant de points qui permettront d’appréhender en quoi les mutuelles, acteurs de l’économie sociale et solidaire, ont une façon différente d’assurer les biens et les personnes. Nous verrons aussi que le modèle fait face à des défis majeurs depuis quelques années, à la fois sur le champ de sa gouvernance dont il doit renouveler l’attractivité et sur le champ de l’environnement réglementaire, particulièrement mouvant. Nous allons dans cet épisode poursuivre notre exploration des spécificités des mutuelles : en quoi sont-elles un acteur particulièrement engagé dans la société ? Comment contribuent-elles au développement des territoires ou de la finance solidaire ? Comment accompagnent-elles leurs sociétaires les plus fragiles ? Comment agissent-elles en faveur du développement durable ? Pourquoi peut-on dire qu’elles sont une source majeure d’innovation sociale ?

There's something here for everyone whether you are just looking for the basics or have years of experience in the dairy industry. This is an eight-week course. Each week consists of four to nine video lectures, additional reading materials, and a multiple-choice questions quiz. Estimated study time is between three and five hours per week. Learners have the option to purchase a Course Certificate for 49.00 USD. The certificate can be purchased at any time, but you must verify your identify before taking the course quizzes in order to be eligible.

Milk provides humans with over 16 essential nutrients, such as: Energy, Protein and Essential Amino acids, Vitamin A, Vitamin D, several B vitamins, including B12, Pantothenic and Folic acids, and essential minerals such as Calcium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Zinc, as well as other minerals. Did you know that one glass of milk provides a 5-year old child with 21% of his/her daily protein requirements and 8% of their energy needs?  Most milk in the world, about 85%, is produced from cattle. However, water buffaloes, goats, sheep, and camel are also dairy animals. The United States, India, the European Union, Brazil, and New Zealand are among the largest dairy producers in the world. Yet among these dairy-producing countries there are varied methods to generate milk with highly variable productivity and efficiency. Dairy production is vital for the survival of billions of people. Globally, around 150 million small-scale dairy households, equivalent to 750 million people, are engaged in milk production. The number and size of dairy farms varies among countries, but in India alone, there are estimated 78 million dairy farms! In the United States, one of the leading milk-producing countries in the world, total milk production has been steadily increasing in the last decades, reaching over 205 billion pounds (93 billion kilograms) in 2014. This was accompanied by a steady increase in average milk yield per cow, reaching 22,260 lb (over 10,100 kg) per lactation in 2014. How has this efficiency been achieved? What methods are necessary to ensure production of high quality milk? How do we balance milk production efficiency with animal health and environmental protection? This course will provide the student with information to better understand dairy production systems and their role in feeding the world population.  In this MOOOOO-C, you will learn about the dairy enterprise from internationally recognized dairy science professors who have delivered highly regarded dairy education programs within the United States and internationally.  Course lectures are translated into Portuguese and Chinese PDF files of these translations can be found under each course week. The Dairy MOOC team thanks Dr. Antonio Branco (Universidade Estadual de Maringá, Brazil) and Ms. Yuanyuan Zhang (Pennsylvania State University) for translating the lecture materials.

In the Dairy Genetics module, you will learn about the different breeds of dairy cattle, their popularity and how performance varies from one breed to the next. We will consider the many different traits that are evaluated by farmers and breeders during genetic selection, and how we collect data to conduct genetic evaluations. In order to simplify the selection process we will consider selection indexes. You will learn how dairy cattle have changed over the last half-century, and the factors that alter the rate of genetic progress. Finally, you will learn about the technologies that have helped to accelerate genetic gain in dairy cattle such as artificial insemination and genomic testing. Those of you, who would like to get more engaged in discussions and are interested in completing the Course Certificate requirements, can participate in discussion forums and take the weekly quiz.

Enjoy this week's material and the entire course!  Calf health, growth, and productivity rely heavily on nutrition and management practices. Every heifer calf born on a dairy farm represents an opportunity to maintain or increase herd size, to improve the herd genetically, or to improve economic returns to the farm. The objectives of raising the newborn calf to weaning age are optimizing growth and minimizing health problems. In this video we will discuss the development of the calf's digestive system, learn how important colostrum is for the immune system, and the nutrients the calf needs to be healthy and grow well. We will discuss critical phases of growth for the dairy heifer, the importance of good facilities, and how nutrition plays an important role in getting a healthy well grown heifer ready to be bred and prepared to have her first calf.Proper management and nutrition of the dairy cow transitioning into lactation is very important for obtaining a healthy calf, increased reproductive efficiency and optimal milk production in the following lactation. We will learn how this can be achieved by feeding balanced diets, providing good cow comfort, and assuring the cow is in good body condition before and after she calves. There are many feeding strategies that work for feeding dry cows however the goal should always be to provide high quality feed sources, consistent availability of feed, adequate bunk space and a comfortable environment. We will discuss  how best to manage and feed the dry cow prior to calving so she can transition into lactation with a healthy calf and produce high quality milk. Those of you, who would like to get more engaged in discussions and are interested in completing the Course Certificate requirements, can participate in discussion forums and take the weekly quiz. Enjoy this week's material and the entire course! This week you will learn basic concepts related to reproduction on dairy farms.

Next will be a discussion of the basic anatomy and function of the male and female reproductive tracts. This will be followed by an overview of the bovine estrous cycle and the main hormones and ovarian structures that control the cycle. We will follow this with a discussion of factors controlling the expression of estrus by dairy cows and how to be more effective at detecting estrus. We will highlight the critical need to time ovulation and insemination to maximize conception rates and will discuss some of the factors which reduce conception rates. This will be illustrated by a discussion of the key reproductive metric, pregnancy rate. Viewers will learn about strategies to increase pregnancy rates and will better understand methods used for pregnancy detection along with the critical need for early and accurate pregnancy detection to maximize the farms’ pregnancy rates. Those of you, who would like to get more engaged in discussions and are interested in completing the Course Certificate requirements, can participate in discussion forums and take the weekly quiz.

In Week 7 of this course, you will learn about disease concerns of dairy cows and calves and management practices addressing diagnosis and prevention. Our discussions will progress from first establishing disease prevention concepts of biosecurity and evolutionary change to dairy herd health programs. The next three discussions will focus on disease issues related to the calving cow, calf and lactating cow. These lessons will provide background information and practical skills in recognizing disease problems early in an effort to minimize adverse consequences on animal health and performance. The last two discussions will focus on disease treatment and prevention practices in addressing important conceptual approaches as specific mechanisms for treatment and prevention are dependent upon regulatory issues within a given country. We will address the controversial issue of antibiotic usage in the treatment of cows as an important concern for food production, but also as part of good animal care and ensuring animal welfare. Preventive practices of vaccination strategies and parasite control will be framed in a conceptual approach that could be applied to differing farm situations. Finally our discussion will emphasize the importance of good nutrition, thus linking information from other course modules, to establishing proper dairy management practices to ensuring quality cow care and minimizing disease risks.

This course provides a framework to analyze these concerns as you examine the ethical and privacy implications of collecting and managing big data. Explore the broader impact of the data science field on modern society and the principles of fairness, accountability and transparency as you gain a deeper understanding of the importance of a shared set of ethical values. You will examine the need for voluntary disclosure when leveraging metadata to inform basic algorithms and/or complex artificial intelligence systems while also learning best practices for responsible data management, understanding the significance of the Fair Information Practices Principles Act and the laws concerning the right to be forgotten.  This course will help you answer questions such as who owns data, how do we value privacy, how to receive informed consent and what it means to be fair.  Data scientists and anyone beginning to use or expand their use of data will benefit from this course. No particular previous knowledge needed. Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish The mission of the University of Michigan is to serve the people of Michigan and the world through preeminence in creating, communicating, preserving and applying knowledge, art, and academic values, and in developing leaders and citizens who will challenge the present and enrich the future. Module 1 of this course establishes a basic foundation in the notion of simple utilitarian ethics we use for this course. The lecture material and the quiz questions are designed to get most people to come to an agreement about right and wrong, using the utilitarian framework taught here. If you bring your own moral sense to bear, or think hard about possible counter-arguments, it is likely that you can arrive at a different conclusion. But that discussion is not what this course is about. So resist that temptation, so that we can jointly lay a common foundation for the rest of this course. Early experiments on human subjects were by scientists intent on advancing medicine, to the benefit of all humanity, disregard for welfare of individual human subjects. Often these were performed by white scientists, on black subject. In this module we will talk about the laws that govern the Principle of Informed Consent. We will also discuss why informed consent doesn’t work well for retrospective studies, or for the customers of electronic businesses. Who owns data about you? We'll explore that question in this module. A few examples of personal data include copyrights for biographies ownership of photos posted online, Yelp, Trip Advisor, public data capture, and data sale. We'll also explore the limits on recording and use of data.  Privacy is a basic human need. Privacy means the ability to control information about yourself, not necessarily the ability to hide things. We have seen the rise different value systems with regards to privacy. Kids today are more likely to share personal information on social media, for example. So while values are changing, this doesn’t remove the fundamental need to be able to control personal information. In this module we'll examine the relationship between the services we are provided and the data we provide in exchange: for example, the location for a cell phone. We'll also compare and contrast data against metadata. Certain transactions can be performed anonymously. But many cannot, including where there is physical delivery of product. Two examples related to anonymous transactions we'll look at are block chains and bitcoin. We'll also look at some of the drawbacks that come with anonymity. Data validity is not a new concern. All too often, we see the inappropriate use of Data Science methods leading to erroneous conclusions. This module points out common errors, in language suited for a student with limited exposure to statistics. We'll focus on the notion of representative sample: opinionated customers, for example, are not necessarily representative of all customers. What could be fairer than a data-driven analysis? Surely the dumb computer cannot harbor prejudice or stereotypes. While indeed the analysis technique may be completely neutral, given the assumptions, the model, the training data, and so forth, all of these boundary conditions are set by humans, who may reflect their biases in the analysis result, possibly without even intending to do so. Only recently have people begun to think about how algorithmic decisions can be unfair. Consider this article, published in the New York Times. This module discusses this cutting edge issue. In Module 8, we consider societal consequences of Data Science that we should be concerned about even if there are no issues with fairness, validity, anonymity, privacy, ownership or human subjects research. These “systemic” concerns are often the hardest to address, yet just as important as other issues discussed before. For example, we consider ossification, or the tendency of algorithmic methods to learn and codify the current state of the world and thereby make it harder to change. Information asymmetry has long been exploited for the advantage of some, to the disadvantage of others. Information technology makes spread of information easier, and hence generally decreases asymmetry. However, Big Data sets and sophisticated analyses increase asymmetry in favor of those with ability to acquire/access.  Finally, in Module 9, we tie all the issues we have considered together into a simple, two-point code of ethics for the practitioner.

The rapid urbanisation has resulted in for example inadequate infrastructure, physical inactivity, gentrification, air pollution, and growing numbers of slum dwellers. All factors challenging health and wellbeing of the people living in the cities. In addition, when addressing climate change it has become of paramount importance to look at mitigation and adaptation investments tailored to the urban context.  As stated in the Sustainable Development Goal 11 adopted by all United Nations member states in 2015, societies need to be at the forefront in the continuous management and design of urban spaces to secure that cities and human settlements are inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.  In this course, you will learn about the key determinants of urban health including demography, climate change, air pollution, noise, transport systems, public and blue and green spaces, and policies and investments affecting sense of community and public safety. You will get a historical overview of the major trends in urban planning and meet a range of stakeholders in urban planning who will provide examples of innovative methods and people-centered approaches to create sustainable solutions.   Finally, you will be provided with a series of resources to inspire you to help create awareness and action around an idea or sustainable solution in the field of urbanisation and health.  The course has been developed (with support from EIT Health) in a partnership between the University of Copenhagen,  Universidad Politécnica de Madrid  and University of Coimbra.   Researchers and stakeholders in urban planning will introduce you to cases from cities in Denmark, Spain, Portugal and many other urban settings across the world.   The aim of the course is to further interdisciplinary knowledge on urbanisation and health. We plan for the courses to reach citizens and activists as well planners, practitioners and decision-makers with a professional interest in sustainable urban planning from countries around the world. Subtitles: English, Portuguese (European), Spanish Subtitles: English, Portuguese (European), Spanish The University of Copenhagen is the oldest University in Denmark - founded in 1479, and with over 38,000 students and more than 9,000 employees. The purpose of the University is to conduct research and provide education to the highest academic level. Based in Denmark's capital city it is one of the top research institutions in Europe.  Universidad Politécnica de Madrid is the oldest and largest Spanish technical university, with more than 4.000 faculty members, 38.000 undergraduate students and 6.000 postgraduates in 21 Schools which cover most of engineering disciplines.  More than 2,400 researchers carry out their activity at the UPM, grouped in 204 Research Groups, 19 Research Centers and 55 Laboratories. The intense collaboration with governmental bodies and industry guarantees  that research at the UPM offers real solutions to real-world problems. Recently, European Commission has approved the EELISA (European Engineering Learning Innovation and Science Alliance) lead by Universidad Politécnica de Madrid in collaboration with other universities across Europe in order to reinforce the committment of European Universities towards the Sustainable Development Goals and the current social challenges of XXI century. The University of Coimbra was founded in 1290 and constitutes a reference in higher education and R&I in Portugal, with academic reputation recognized worldwide. It includes eight faculties and over 30 research units, covering almost all study fields (Engineering, Technology, Life and Health Sciences, Architecture, Economy, Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities, Psychology, Pharmacy and Sports) as well as several bodies devoted to interdisciplinary research, arts and culture. UC offers advanced training programs in different areas that bind to technology, being considered by EC as one of the 20 most inspiring cases in Europe. Knowledge and technology transfer is at its core, resulting in successful initiatives, like IPN Incubator, TECBis- Business accelerator unit and Biocant, and in the creation of more than 200 spin-offs, most of them health-related. EIT Health was established in 2015, as a ‘knowledge and innovation community’ (KIC) of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT). The EIT is made up of various KICs who each focus on a different sector, or area, of innovation – in our case, that is health and aging. The idea behind the EIT KICs is that innovation flourishes best when the right people are brought together to share expertise. The so called ‘knowledge triangle’, is the principle that when experts from business, research and education work together as one, an optimal environment for innovation is created. This module will provide you with an overview of the key determinants of urban health. We will take you on a journey mainly through the European history of urbanisation and urban planning to reflect on the way health concerns  and wellbeing have been considered and how general trends here have influenced the design of cities all across the world. Finally, we will dive into the causes and effects of air pollution and noise, two of the major health hazards in today’s urban settings. We hope the readings and resources will inspire you to begin exploring your own urban setting in terms of e.g. density and different kinds of pollution.  The world population is undergoing major changes. The share of urban population is increasing, as does that of people aged 65 or over.  In this module we will focus on the concept of ageing across the lifecycle, and on how different features of urban environment influence health and the ageing process. Furthermore, we will explore the phenomenon of gentrification and its impact on health in different segments of our populations. In the reading and resources section you will find shortcuts to databases and cases from different cities. On many different levels evidence confirm how crucial the integration of elements of nature in the urban design is to sustain physical as well as mental health. In this module you will be introduced to blue and green planning as an instrument to promote health and mitigate and adapt to climate changes. We will look at the benefits of green space and small-scale urban farming from a community and health perspective. You will also meet examples of how new ways of designing public space motivates citizens to lead a daily physically active and healthy life. In the readings and resource section you will find more in depth material on nature based solutions and effects on climate change. How can we align urban planning with UN’s Sustainable Development Goals? In an urban context, how can we bend the curve of obesity? How can we reduce mortality and disease associated with the layout of the urban space and namely the way we design our transport systems? In this module you will meet stakeholders who are globally engaged in the development and implementation of sustainable approaches to resolve some of the major health related challenges that cities are facing globally. Further, you will get access to tools and frameworks for your own use   Maybe you are already involved in activities that support a healthy and sustainable development in your own neighborhood or city, or even across cities. Or maybe you would like to get started or take action in a new way. Now is your chance to mature and consider how you can best convince others to engage in your idea! In the previous modules we have identified the key determinants to urban health and provided examples of prevailing methods to come up with sustainable solutions.

Even the most sophisticated statistical analyses are not useful to a business if they do not lead to actionable advice, or if the answers to those business questions are not conveyed in a way that non-technical people can understand.   In this course you will learn how to become a master at communicating business-relevant implications of data analyses.  By the end, you will know how to structure your data analysis projects to ensure the fruits of your hard labor yield results for your stakeholders.  You will also know how to streamline your analyses and highlight their implications efficiently using visualizations in Tableau, the most popular visualization program in the business world.  Using other Tableau features, you will be able to make effective visualizations that harness the human brain’s innate perceptual and cognitive tendencies to convey conclusions directly and clearly.  Finally, you will be practiced in designing and persuasively presenting business “data stories” that use these visualizations, capitalizing on business-tested methods and design principles.

We use Excel to do our calculations, and all math formulas are given as Excel Spreadsheets, but we do not attempt to cover Excel Macros, Visual Basic, Pivot Tables, or other intermediate-to-advanced Excel functionality. This course will prepare you to design and implement realistic predictive models based on data. In the Final Project (module 6) you will assume the role of a business data analyst for a bank, and develop two different predictive models to determine which applicants for credit cards should be accepted and which rejected. Your first model will focus on minimizing default risk, and your second on maximizing bank profits. The two models should demonstrate to you in a practical, hands-on way the idea that your choice of business metric drives your choice of an optimal model.  The second big idea this course seeks to demonstrate is that your data-analysis results cannot and should not aim to eliminate all uncertainty. Your role as a data-analyst is to reduce uncertainty for decision-makers by a financially valuable increment, while quantifying how much uncertainty remains. You will learn to calculate and apply to real-world examples the most important uncertainty measures used in business, including classification error rates, entropy of information, and confidence intervals for linear regression.  All the data you need is provided within the course, all assignments are designed to be done in MS Excel, and you will learn enough Excel to complete all assignments. The course will give you enough practice with Excel to become fluent in its most commonly used business functions, and you’ll be ready to learn any other Excel functionality you might need in the future (module 1).  The course does not cover Visual Basic or Pivot Tables and you will not need them to complete the assignments. All advanced concepts are demonstrated in individual Excel spreadsheet templates that you can use to answer relevant questions. You will emerge with substantial vocabulary and practical knowledge of how to apply business data analysis methods based on binary classification (module 2), information theory and entropy measures (module 3), and linear regression (module 4 and 5), all using no software tools more complex than Excel.

In this module, will explore the essential Excel skills to address typical business situations you may encounter in the future. The Excel vocabulary and functions taught throughout this module make it possible for you to understand the additional explanatory Excel spreadsheets that accompany later videos in this course.  Separating collections into two categories, such as “buy this stock, don’t but that stock” or “target this customer with a special offer, but not that one” is the ultimate goal of most business data-analysis projects. There is a specialized vocabulary of measures for comparing and optimizing the performance of the algorithms used to classify collections into two groups. You will learn how and why to apply these different metrics, including how to calculate the all-important AUC: the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve.  In this module, you will learn how to calculate and apply the vitally useful uncertainty metric known as “entropy.” In contrast to the more familiar “probability” that represents the uncertainty that a single outcome will occur, “entropy” quantifies the aggregate uncertainty of all possible outcomes. The entropy measure provides the framework for accountability in data-analytic work. Entropy gives you the power to quantify the uncertainty of future outcomes relevant to your business twice: using the best-available estimates before you begin a project, and then again after you have built a predictive model. The difference between the two measures is the Information Gain contributed by your work. The Linear Correlation measure is a much richer metric for evaluating associations than is commonly realized. You can use it to quantify how much a linear model reduces uncertainty.  When used to forecast future outcomes, it can be converted into a “point estimate” plus a “confidence interval,” or converted into an information gain measure. You will develop a fluent knowledge of these concepts and the many valuable uses to which linear regression is put in business data analysis. This module also teaches how to use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to solve practical problems. The two topics are closely related because regression and the CLT both make use of a special family of probability distributions called “Gaussians.” You will learn everything you need to know to work with Gaussians in these and other contexts.  This module gives you additional valuable concepts and skills related to building high-quality models.  As you know, a “model” is a description of a process applied to available data (inputs) that produces an estimate of a future and as yet unknown outcome as output.  Very often, models for outputs take the form of a probability distribution. This module covers how to estimate probability distributions from data (a “probability histogram”), and how to describe and generate the most useful probability distributions used by data scientists. It also covers in detail how to develop a binary classification model with parameters optimized to maximize the AUC, and how to apply linear regression models when your input consists of multiple types of data for each event.  The module concludes with an explanation of “over-fitting” which is the main reason that apparently good predictive models often fail in real life business settings. We conclude with some tips for how you can avoid over-fitting in you own predictive model for the final project – and in real life. The final course project is a comprehensive assessment covering all of the course material, and consists of four quizzes and a peer review assignment.  For quiz one and quiz two, there are learning points that explain components of the quiz.  These learning points will unlock only after you complete the quiz with a passing grade. Before you start, please read through the final project instructions.  From past student experience, the final project which includes all the quizzes and peer assessment, takes anywhere from 10-12 hours.

What information is required when taking a patient history or completing a mental state examination? These are just some of the questions you'll seek answers to as you work through the course material.  Mental health is an important public issue across the world, and the role of the psychiatrist is crucial in helping to address these.  This course aims to give you a more nuanced understanding of the role of a psychiatrist, developing clinical skills and therapeutic relationships. Understanding the impact of mental illness in society and ethics in medicine are some of the key themes central to this course.  This course is designed to provide essential background knowledge and practical skills that apply to any mental health clinical setting.

Established in 1853, it is Australia's second oldest University. Welcome to The University of Melbourne Massive Open Online Course in International Psychiatry. This course has been designed to provide essential background knowledge and practical skills for health professionals working with mentally unwell patients. In this first week of the course, you will learn about the importance of good communication skills.  Working effectively and collaboratively with patients is the goal of every mental health professional. This can often be challenging for practitioners, especially when patients are very unwell or reluctant to seek help. Good communication skills are essential to engage patients and families, and to build therapeutic relationships with our clients. In this module we will look at skills and concepts that come in useful when interviewing patients. Welcome to the Clinical Skills module. The focus of this week's learning will on skills and concepts that come in useful when documenting a psychiatric patient history. The Mental State Examination (MSE) is a core skill in psychiatry, and an integral part of the patient interview. This week we will look at each component of the MSE, and how to classify, interpret, and document the patient’s presentation Now that you are familiar with the Mental State Examination, you will be required to write and submit your second peer reviewed assignment for this course - documenting a mental state examination.  Later this week, we'll take a closer look at 'the biopsychosocial model' - a framework for integrating different aspects of the patient’s life into a wholistic understanding of their mental illness. In this module, you will learn about the model, and apply it to a clinical scenario. Health professionals occupy an important role in society, and there are expectations about how they conduct themselves in this role. Sufferers of mental illness can be particularly vulnerable, and it’s important that the law and professional ethics are followed to protect them. Furthermore, societal and cultural factors have a significant influence on the manifestation and management of mental illnesses. In this module we will explore these important topics. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:10h:1|2;Java

Since our foundation 54 years ago, we have aspired to be a different type of university: one focused on fostering collaboration between students, academics, industry and society. Welcome to Week 1! This week we will discuss and review the evolution of online course design. Advancements in technology have fundamentally changed the way learners can study. Students and learners can now choose from a range of course model types and most current course models have an online learning component. It is expected that online learning will continue to grow in popularity as more and more students gain access to the internet throughout the world.  Welcome to Week 2! This week you will explore the key concept of transactional distance, a phrase coined by Michael Moore in 1998. Being physically distant from your students presents a number of challenges but building on online presence can reduce some of these issues. We will also explore three key concepts related to Moore’s early work developed by Garrison, Anderson and Archer (2000), and built into their Critical Community of Inquiry Model. The concepts are 1) teacher presence, 2) social presence and 3) cognitive presence. These three concepts inform teacher behaviours and learning design characteristics that are crucial to the successful delivery and online learning experience of students.   Welcome to Week 3! This week we will examine the concept of cognitive load. As educators, we need to be mindful that cognitive load pressures can adversely affect our student's ability to learn. So, this week we will explore some practical tips and techniques to prevent cognitive overload. We will also discuss the importance of creating a supportive, inclusive and welcoming online learning environment and will show you some practical tips and techniques to set up your online course where your students can thrive.  Welcome to Week 4! This week we will define the term 'learning community', then learn how to create a learning community using online discussion forums. Research tells us that meaningful, inclusive and supportive learning communities help students feel a sense of belonging. This sense of belonging can support deep learning and as a result improve student performance. As you will learn this week, discussion forums are popular tools that online educators can use to build learning effective learning communities of their very own. Welcome to Week 5! This week we look forward and explore the question, what will happen next in online education? We will investigate emerging technologies such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence, and discuss their potential impact on the online education sector. We will finish this course discussing the importance for every online educator to continuously upskill and improve their skills in online teaching. We will give you some practical tips and help you to create your own future online teaching professional development action plan.

But the air we breathe is polluted both outdoors and indoors. Each year, this pollution costs 7 million lives across the globe – and a lot of suffering. 1 in 8 deaths is due to air pollution. This course will provide you with an introduction to the most recent research in the field of health effects of air pollution as well as a broader understanding of sources and spread of air pollution and what we should do about it. What is air pollution? What are the sources? How and where are we exposed outdoors and indoors? What happens in the body? Which diseases are the result? Who are the most vulnerable? How can we assess the effects of air pollution? And what should we do to reach the Sustainable Development Goal to “substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution”? These are some of the important questions we will address in the course.  During the course you will meet researchers and experts from the University of Copenhagen and the Technical University of Denmark. They work with different aspects of air pollution and health: toxicology, exposure assessment, epidemiology, engineering and health impact assessment. It is a global responsibility to combat the health impacts of air pollution, and this fight can only be won through new knowledge and global collaboration.   We hope you will join us in the course and equip yourself to take part in this global and individual health challenge.

The purpose of the University is to conduct research and provide education to the highest academic level. Based in Denmark's capital city it is one of the top research institutions in Europe.  The air we breathe is full of particles and gases. Some occur naturally, but many are the result of human activities. This first module will look into what air pollution is, where it comes from and what it does to our lungs and the rest of our body. Outdoor air pollution affects all of us – no matter where we are on the Globe. But there are big differences in air pollution levels from one country to another, from rural to urban areas, from city to city, and even from one side of the street to the other. Though all people are affected, some people are more vulnerable to the damaging health effects of air pollution than others. This module will explain about how we can study health effects of exposure to outdoor air pollution in diverse population groups.  We will also look at what we can do to fight outdoor pollution – and cope with it. Most people spend most of their time indoors. The building envelope traps and accumulates pollution from both indoor and outdoor sources. This module will explain about health effects of indoor use of solid fuel as a particularly important source in large parts of the world, as well as of other sources of indoor air pollution. You will also learn about what you can do to improve the air quality in your home. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:37h:1|2;Java

Multimodal texts provide a variety of ways in which to communicate and provide information to learners, as well as meet the needs of different learners’ preferences. Using video, podcasts, infographics or images as well as text, directly impacts learning outcomes. Design decisions that incorporate multimodal learning objects – made by both educators and learners – can make learning memorable, meaningful and retainable.  Decisions we make about how we communicate should be done through a systematic and informed process, rather than via a random selection of tools. In this course, you’ll explore learning design principles associated with how, why and when to use multimodal texts. You’ll also explore and analyse the features and benefits of a range of text types, such as video, audio and infographics.  The course is designed for educators, teachers, learning designers, instructional designers, tutors, lecturers, course convenors and anyone else who may be interested in creating powerful and memorable learning experiences for learners of all ages.  Learning outcomes  By the end of this course, you’ll:  1. Recognise best practice design principles and approaches for multimodal text creation  2. Select, design and create a variety of multimodal text types, including video, audio and infographics  3. Critically reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of the different multimodal text types Subtitles: English Subtitles: English Macquarie is ranked among the top one per cent of universities in the world, and with a 5-star QS rating, we are recognised for producing graduates who are among the most sought-after professionals in the world. Since our foundation 54 years ago, we have aspired to be a different type of university: one focused on fostering collaboration between students, academics, industry and society. Welcome to week 1! It is important to consider some design parameters before you start to create your own multimodal learning objects. This week, we’ll explore four key principle that will inform the design of the learning sequence in which your learning objects will sit. They are time, space, purpose and the online instructor's role. We'll also explore the 'rapid-design process' and provide you with some tools and techniques for the weeks of multimodal learning object creation ahead. Get ready to design and create you very own multimodal text types! Welcome to week 2! This week you will be given the opportunity to design and build your own infographic. Infographics can add real value to an online course when designed, developed and implemented well. As you will discover this week, there are many advantages of incorporating infographics into your own online course. We'd argue that infographics work best if they are paired with a 'friend'. What do we mean by this? Continue on to learn more!    Welcome to Week 3!  Audio resources and educational podcasts are growing in popularity. Do you listen to podcasts or e-books? This week we dive into audio text type creation. Creating your own podcast can be fun and simple. This week you will have the chance to listen to some experienced podcasters who have created their own podcasts specifically for their learners. Welcome to week 4! Visual storytelling can help make complex stories easier to understand and, as a result, deliver a more impactful message. That is the power of video, as you will discover this week when you create your own video. Creating a powerful instructional video learning resource is a time consuming and intensive process. This week we'll share some tips and tricks with you that will save you time and energy when you make your own instructional videos. Lights! Camera! Action!  Welcome to week 5! We hope that you've enjoyed designing and creating your own learning objects. Now it's time to prototype and iterate the three learning objects you've made so far. To improve our learning objects we can ask our friends and colleagues for feedback. This week we will focus on the importance of both providing and receiving effective feedback, and share with you a structured way to give and receive meaningful and constructive feedback, which is called the 'critical friend protocol'.

Our products are engineered for security, reliability, and scalability, running the full stack from infrastructure to applications to devices and hardware. Our teams are dedicated to helping customers apply our technologies to create success. Google Cloud Platform offers four main kinds of services: Compute, Storage, Big Data, and Machine Learning. This course focuses mostly on the first two, together with Google Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networking. This module orients learners to the basics of Google Cloud Platform. It traces the evolution of cloud computing and explains what is unique about Google's approach to it. The module introduces the key structural concepts of regions and zones.   GCP customers use projects to organize the resources they use. They use Google Cloud Identity and Access Management, also called “IAM,” to control who can do what with those resources. They use any of several technologies to connect with GCP. This module covers each of these topics, and it introduces a service called Cloud Launcher that is an easy way to get started with GCP. Compute Engine lets you run virtual machines on Google’s global infrastructure. This module covers how Compute Engine works, with a focus on Google virtual networking.  Every application needs to store data. Different applications and workloads require different storage and database solutions. This module describes and differentiates among GCP's core storage options: Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, Cloud Datastore, and Google Bigtable. Containers are simple and interoperable, and they enable seamless, fine-grained scaling. Kubernetes is an orchestration layer for containers. Kubernetes Engine is Kubernetes as a service, a scalable managed offering that runs on Google’s infrastructure. You direct the creation of a cluster, and Kubernetes Engine schedules your containers into the cluster and manages them automatically, based on requirements you define. This module explains how Kubernetes Engine works and how it helps deploy applications in containers. App Engine is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering. The App Engine platform manages the hardware and networking infrastructure required to run your code. App Engine provides built-in services that many web applications need. This module describes how App Engine works. Popular tools for development, deployment, and monitoring just work in GCP. Customers also have options for tools in each of these three areas that are tightly integrated with GCP. This module covers those tools. GCP's big-data and machine learning offerings are intended to help customers get the most out of data. These tools are intended to be simple and practical to embed in your applications. This module describes the available big-data and machine learning services and explains the usefulness of each. This module reviews the GCP services covered in this course and reminds learners of the differences among them. The module compares GCP compute services, GCP storage services, and important Google VPC networking capabilities. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:40h:1|2;Java

This course, taught by Dr. Martin E.P. Seligman brings all the key concepts from the first four courses to practice as you develop and test a new positive intervention for an audience of your choice. You identify opportunities in your daily life to increase the wellbeing by using knowledge you developed in the first four courses of the Specialization. In this final project, you evaluate the efficacy of a positive intervention based on subjective and objective measures. Then, you compare how empirical and non-empirically-based positive interventions can be applied to influence a person's wellbeing. Lastly, you reflect on how the fundamental elements of research methods are important in the everyday application of positive psychology. After completing all five courses, learners earn a certificate signed by Dr. Martin E.P. Seligman, Dr. James Pawelski, Dr. Angela Duckworth, Dr. Claire Robertson-Kraft and Dr. Karen Reivich.

A member of the Ivy League, Penn is the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, and considers itself to be the first university in the United States with both undergraduate and graduate studies.  Module 1 of the Positive Psychology Capstone reviews the VIA Character Strengths Classification and in particular asks the learner to identify his or her five signature strengths and assess if they are authentic. Module 2 presents Chris Peterson's unfinished theory on mental illness. Specifically his belief that the absence of strengths, the excess of strengths, and the opposite of strengths might define 72 conditions of character weakness, and that these shortcomings might be a better framework than the DSM which uses a checklist of symptoms. Module 3 has the learner target an area for remediation from among Peterson's inventory of 72 deviant strengths and craft a positive intervention using a signature strength.  Module 4 has the learner put the positive intervention into action, assess and the share the results, and finally reduce the positive intervention to writing so it can be shared.

348;/var/www/html/img/products/productImage347.jpg;From Disease to Genes and Back;From Disease to Genes and Back;Genomics,Genetics,Bioinformatics,Disease,Probability & Statistics;210;258.3;Human genetics explores the genetically determined similarities and differences between human beings. This scientific discipline encompasses a variety of related fields such as molecular genetics, genomics, population genetics and medical genetics. Study of human genetics can help to find answers to questions regarding the inheritance and development of different human phenotypes. The field of medical genetics is quickly growing and dynamically developing thanks to the new technologies such as the next-generation sequencing.  Most human diseases have a genetic component. This genetic component varies by disease. Some rare diseases appear to be completely determined by the genome, whereas more common diseases arise from a complex interplay of many genes, the environment and chance. The understanding of how our genomes contribute to disease susceptibility offers the prospect of large gains: it may guide disease diagnostics and prognostics and help in developing new therapies.  The overall goal of this course is to describe how the researchers find genes responsible for different diseases and how this information is used to better understand and fight these diseases. You will learn about current approaches for finding single genetic variants underlying monogenic (Mendelian) diseases and sets of variants responsible for more complex, multifactorial ones. Furthermore, you will learn how the identification of these genetic variants makes it possible to understand how the affected biological pathways lead to disease development. During the final week of the course, we will talk more about clinical applications of the genetic findings.  Upon completing the course,  you will be able to:  - give examples of monogenic and complex disorders  - recognise patterns of Mendelian inheritance of monogenic diseases - understand and describe principles and methods of gene mapping  - describe the main steps and principles of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) - give examples of modern technologies that are currently used to find variants underlying human diseases - discuss the approaches to finding causative variants underlying complex disorders - discuss the possibilities and areas of application of genetic findings. Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish, Japanese Subtitles: French, Portuguese (European), Russian, English, Spanish, Japanese Novosibirsk State University (NSU) is a research university located in Novosibirsk Akademgorodok, the world-famous scientific center in Siberia. 80% of NSU teachers are active researchers affiliated with the Russian Academy of Sciences therefore education is closely linked to world-class science: our students get first-hand knowledge about scientific discoveries before they are published.  Nearly 6000 students (including international students from 37 countries) are enrolled at undergraduate and graduate programs offered by 13 departments. The leading areas of NSU expertise are natural sciences, life sciences, physics, math, IT, and more. This week you will learn about human genome organisation. This week is very important as all this knowledge will form a basis for all of the subsequent weeks of the course. Michel Georges will tell you about the structural organisation of the human genome, the mechanisms contributing to the genome variability, the main types of genetic variation (SNPs, CNVs, aneuploidy, etc.), and differences between alleles and genotypes. You will also learn the techniques used to detect different types of variations in human genome and you will find out how we can follow the inheritance of genetic material through generations.  During this week, Yurii Aulchenko will teach you the basics of population and quantitative genetics. Population genetics is a branch of genetics that deals with genetic variation among individuals in a population. Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution is a quotation from a 1973 essay by the evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky. The fundamental importance of population genetics lies in the insights it provides into the mechanisms of evolution, thus allowing geneticists to better understand the drivers behind the organization and functioning of human genomes. You will learn about such phenomena as population structure, selection and genetic drift. You will also learn about quantitative genetics, which studies how the genes and environment control variations in complex phenotypes. Mendelian or monogenic disorders are the kind of genetic disorders in humans that arise from a mutation in a single gene. These disorders run in families and can be autosomal or sex-linked depending whether the affected gene is located on autosomes or sex chromosomes, and they can also be dominant or recessive depending if one or two alleles are necessary to develop the disorder. The name “Mendelian” is used because these diseases follow simple monogenic patterns of inheritance, similar to these first studied by Gregor Mendel in pea plants. There are an estimated 8000 rare Mendelian diseases. Although each of them are very rare, collectively they affect millions of individuals world-wide. How can we find the variants and genes that are responsible for the development of these diseases? You will learn about “linkage analysis” – a technique that has been previously used for this purpose. You will also learn about Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies that have revolutionized the studies of Mendelian diseases in recent years.  In contrast to Mendelian disorders that are controlled by a mutation in one gene, the multifactorial disorders are more complex, thus the name. These disorders are affected by an interplay of many genetic and environmental factors and also by a chance. Most of the human disorders, including prevalent types of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, different cancers, are of such type. Although these disorders often cluster in families, they do not segregate in ways that are consistent with simple Mendelian inheritance. The methods used to find variants responsible for Mendelian disorders are not applicable for complex ones.  Genome-wide association studies, or “GWAS” is a current method of choice to pinpoint the genetic variation predisposing to complex disorders. Yurii Aulchenko together with Lennart Karssen will tell you about this method and discuss its advantages and limitations.   During the last two weeks, we have been discussing the approaches to finding variants and genomic regions underlying the development of human disorders or predisposition to them. The question is – what are the next steps that should be taken in order to prove the causality of the identified variants? Moreover, we are eager to understand if these findings can be translated into the clinics. Can these variants provide predictive or prognostic information and do they have any important pharmacological implications? Will the answers be the same for variants underlying Mendelian and complex disorders? Gert Matthijs, Yurii Aulchenko and Michel Georges will tell you more this week.  This is it. The last week of our course. You have learned a lot during the past five weeks. The final week of the course is the reflection week. We have prepared for you the interviews with Michel Georges, Gert Matthijs and Yurii Aulchenko. These interviews reflect their personal opinions about some of the current and future challenges of human genetics. Additionally, you can put everything you have learned during the course into practice by writing an essay on one of the proposed topics.  ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:41h:1|2;Java

Our products are engineered for security, reliability, and scalability, running the full stack from infrastructure to applications to devices and hardware. Our teams are dedicated to helping customers apply our technologies to create success. Google Cloud Platform offers four main kinds of services: Compute, Storage, Big Data, and Machine Learning. This course focuses mostly on the first two, together with Google Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networking. This module orients learners to the basics of Google Cloud Platform. It traces the evolution of cloud computing and explains what is unique about Google's approach to it. The module introduces the key structural concepts of regions and zones.   GCP customers use projects to organize the resources they use. They use Google Cloud Identity and Access Management, also called “IAM,” to control who can do what with those resources. They use any of several technologies to connect with GCP. This module covers each of these topics, and it introduces a service called Cloud Launcher that is an easy way to get started with GCP. Compute Engine lets you run virtual machines on Google’s global infrastructure. This module covers how Compute Engine works, with a focus on Google virtual networking.  Every application needs to store data. Different applications and workloads require different storage and database solutions. This module describes and differentiates among GCP's core storage options: Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, Cloud Datastore, and Google Bigtable. Containers are simple and interoperable, and they enable seamless, fine-grained scaling. Kubernetes is an orchestration layer for containers. Kubernetes Engine is Kubernetes as a service, a scalable managed offering that runs on Google’s infrastructure. You direct the creation of a cluster, and Kubernetes Engine schedules your containers into the cluster and manages them automatically, based on requirements you define. This module explains how Kubernetes Engine works and how it helps deploy applications in containers. App Engine is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering. The App Engine platform manages the hardware and networking infrastructure required to run your code. App Engine provides built-in services that many web applications need. This module describes how App Engine works. Popular tools for development, deployment, and monitoring just work in GCP. Customers also have options for tools in each of these three areas that are tightly integrated with GCP. This module covers those tools. GCP's big-data and machine learning offerings are intended to help customers get the most out of data. These tools are intended to be simple and practical to embed in your applications. This module describes the available big-data and machine learning services and explains the usefulness of each. This module reviews the GCP services covered in this course and reminds learners of the differences among them. The module compares GCP compute services, GCP storage services, and important Google VPC networking capabilities. ;10;1;1;Długość kursu:25h:1|2;Algorithms

DeepLearning.AIs expert-led educational experiences provide AI practitioners and non-technical professionals with the necessary tools to go all the way from foundational basics to advanced application, empowering them to build an AI-powered future. In the first course in this specialization, you had an introduction to TensorFlow, and how, with its high level APIs you could do basic image classification, and you learned a little bit about Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). In this course you'll go deeper into using ConvNets will real-world data, and learn about techniques that you can use to improve your ConvNet performance, particularly when doing image classification!In Week 1, this week, you'll get started by looking at a much larger dataset than you've been using thus far: The Cats and Dogs dataset which had been a Kaggle Challenge in image classification! You've heard the term overfitting a number of times to this point. Overfitting is simply the concept of being over specialized in training -- namely that your model is very good at classifying what it is trained for, but not so good at classifying things that it hasn't seen. In order to generalize your model more effectively, you will of course need a greater breadth of samples to train it on. That's not always possible, but a nice potential shortcut to this is Image Augmentation, where you tweak the training set to potentially increase the diversity of subjects it covers. You'll learn all about that this week! Building models for yourself is great, and can be very powerful. But, as you've seen, you can be limited by the data you have on hand. Not everybody has access to massive datasets or the compute power that's needed to train them effectively. Transfer learning can help solve this -- where people with models trained on large datasets train them, so that you can either use them directly, or, you can use the features that they have learned and apply them to your scenario. This is Transfer learning, and you'll look into that this week! You've come a long way, Congratulations! One more thing to do before we move off of ConvNets to the next module, and that's to go beyond binary classification. Each of the examples you've done so far involved classifying one thing or another -- horse or human, cat or dog. When moving beyond binary into Categorical classification there are some coding considerations you need to take into account. You'll look at them this week!

Hi Learners and welcome to this course on sequences and prediction! In this course we'll take a look at some of the unique considerations involved when handling sequential time series data -- where values change over time, like the temperature on a particular day, or the number of visitors to your web site. We'll discuss various methodologies for predicting future values in these time series, building on what you've learned in previous courses! Having explored time series and some of the common attributes of time series such as trend and seasonality, and then having used statistical methods for projection, let's now begin to teach neural networks to recognize and predict on time series! Recurrent Neural networks and Long Short Term Memory networks are really useful to classify and predict on sequential data. This week we'll explore using them with time series... On top of DNNs and RNNs, let's also add convolutions, and then put it all together using a real-world data series -- one which measures sunspot activity over hundreds of years, and see if we can predict using it.

Due to python’s simplicity and high readability, it is gaining its importance in the financial industry.  The course combines both python coding and statistical concepts and applies into analyzing financial data, such as stock data.  By the end of the course, you can achieve the following using python:  - Import, pre-process, save and visualize financial data into pandas Dataframe  - Manipulate the existing financial data by generating new variables using multiple columns  - Recall and apply the important statistical concepts (random variable, frequency, distribution, population and sample, confidence interval, linear regression, etc. ) into financial contexts  - Build a trading model using multiple linear regression model   - Evaluate the performance of the trading model using different investment indicators  Jupyter Notebook environment is configured in the course platform for practicing python coding without installing any client applications.

Why do investment banks and consumer banks use Python to build quantitative models to predict returns and evaluate risks? What makes Python one of the most popular tools for financial analysis? You are going to learn basic python to import, manipulate and visualize stock data in this module. As Python is highly readable and simple enough, you can build one of the most popular trading models - Trend following strategy by the end of this module! In the previous module, we built a simple trading strategy base on Moving Average 10 and 50, which are random variables in statistics. In this module, we are going to explore basic concepts of random variables. By understanding the frequency and distribution of random variables, we extend further to the discussion of probability. In the later part of the module, we apply the probability concept in measuring the risk of investing a stock by looking at the distribution of log daily return using python. Learners are expected to have basic knowledge of probability before taking this module. In financial analysis, we always infer the real mean return of stocks, or equity funds, based on the  historical data of a couple years. This situation is in line with a core part of statistics - Statistical Inference - which we also base on sample data to infer the population of a target variable.In this module, you are going to understand the basic concept of statistical inference such as population, samples and random sampling. In the second part of the module, we shall estimate the range of mean return of a stock using a concept called confidence interval, after we understand the distribution of sample mean.We will also testify the claim of investment return using another statistical concept - hypothesis testing. In this module, we will explore the most often used prediction method - linear regression. From learning the association of random variables to simple and multiple linear regression model, we finally come to the most interesting part of this course: we will build a model using multiple indices from the global markets and predict the price change of an ETF of S&P500. In addition to building a stock trading model, it is also great fun to test the performance of your own models, which I will also show you how to evaluate them! ;10;1;1;Długość kursu:46h:1|2;Java

The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant. Three features of the new system are central.  Most important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse.    Second, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective.  Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order.   Third, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That's the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit. Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish, Japanese Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish, Japanese For more than 250 years, Columbia has been a leader in higher education in the nation and around the world. At the core of our wide range of academic inquiry is the commitment to attract and engage the best minds in pursuit of greater human understanding, pioneering new discoveries and service to society. The first two lectures paint a picture of the monetary system as the essential infrastructure of a decentralized market economy.   The second lecture, The Natural Hierarchy of Money, is a kind of high-level overview of the entire course, so don't expect to fully understand it until you look back after completing the rest of the course.  Nevertheless it provides essential orientation for what comes after.  Lectures notes for these and subsequent lectures may be found in the very first segment of this module.   The next two lectures are meant to introduce a key analytical tool, the balance sheet approach to monetary economics, that we will be using repeatedly throughout the course.  As inspiration, first I provide a concrete example of how the approach works by translating the Allyn Young reading into the balance sheet language.  I follow that with a more systematic introduction to this essential tool. In the next four lectures, we build intuition by viewing banking as a payments system, in which every participant faces a daily settlement constraint (a survival constraint).  From this point of view, the wholesale money market plays a key role by allowing banks to relax the discipline of a binding settlement constraint, delaying final payment by putting settlement off until a later date.   The relative importance of the various money markets has changed since the 2008 crisis--Fed Funds is now less important--but the conceptual framework remains valid, indeed not only for dollar money markets but also for non-dollar money markets. The next two lectures extend the payments system frame to non-banks by bringing in repo markets, and to the international monetary system by bringing in Eurodollar markets.   Here, as in the previous two lectures, the emphasis is on settlement, and so implicitly on so-called funding liquidity.  The last three segments of the Eurodollar lecture, on the failure of two seemingly obvious arbitrage conditions, are meant to motivate the shift to market-making and market liquidity in the next module.    Market liquidity is supplied by dealers who stand ready to absorb temporary imbalances in supply and demand by taking the imbalance onto their own balance sheets, for a price.  From this point of view, banks can be considered a special kind of dealer, since they absorb imbalances in payment flows.   The first lecture is meant to build intuition by using our familiar balance sheet method to make sense of how this all worked in a system much simpler than our own.  The second lecture introduces a formal model of the economics of the dealer function, which we will be using throughout the rest of the course.  Here we adapt the Treynor model to banks, which we conceptualize as dealers in money, specifically term funding.  Like Treynor's security dealers, banks supply market liquidity for a price.  But sometimes, in a financial crisis, demand for market liquidity overwhelms supply, and that's where the central bank comes in, as dealer of last resort in money markets.  And if the crisis is big enough, as 2007-2009, the central bank comes in as dealer of last resort in capital markets as well. The first twelve lectures have introduced all of the main concepts of the course.  The midterm exam gives you a chance to test whether you have mastered these concepts before extending them into new areas in the second part of the course.  But before you try the exam, first use the review lecture, and the questions from students, to review the main concepts. The next four lectures extend the money view perspective to the larger world of multiple national monies by thinking about the international monetary system as a payment system, and by thinking of banks as market makers in foreign exchange.  The first lecture is introductory and conceptual, while the second builds intuition by translating Mundell's account of the development of the international monetary system into money view language (similar to what we did at the beginning of the course for Allyn Young's account of the development of the US monetary system). The next two lectures use the Treynor model to understand how exchange rates are determined in dealer markets.  In the second, we confront directly the puzzle we observed earlier in the course, namely why uncovered interest parity (UIP) fails to hold in real world markets. The next four lectures extend the money view to the larger financial world of capital markets, where the price of risk is determined in dealer markets for swaps of various kinds.  The first lecture is a kind of conceptual introduction, while the second translates the standard finance account of forwards and futures into money view terms, as key building block for what comes after. In the modern economy, the price of risk is determined in swap markets that distinguish specific forms of risk, most importantly interest rate swaps and credit default swaps.  The Treynor model can be adapted to understand how the price of risk is formed in dealer markets. In this final module, we bring the entire course together.  These two lectures build on everything that came before, and show how all the pieces fit together into a unified whole.  Specifically, the first lecture uses the conceptual apparatus of the money view to make sense of shadow banking as the quintessential form of banking for the modern financially globalized world.  And the second lecture shows how the conceptual apparatus of the money view fits with standard economics view and finance view, by drawing attention to dimensions of the world from which the standard views abstract. The previous module operated in effect as a review of the entire course, so if you were able to make sense of those lectures, you are ready for the final.  But maybe you first want to have a look back at the second lecture, The Natural Hierarchy of Money, for a high-level summary of the essential concepts of the money view.  For almost everybody, the money view is a new and unfamiliar way of thinking about the world, and it takes a while to get used to it.  The purpose of this course is to plant the seed, by demonstrating the value of this way of thinking for making sense of real world problems.  Once you are done with the final exam, the real work begins, of using the money view to make sense of whatever real world problems confront you in your own daily life. ;10;1;1;Długość kursu:38h:1|2;Java

In this course you will learn what blockchain is and how it can create value by tokenization in cryptocurrencies and in many other practical applications. The applications include: stablecoins (like Facebook’s Libra and JP Morgan’s JPMCoin), machine to machine payments, identity protection, supply chain management (Walmart, Maersk, IBM), secure voting, distributed exchanges, decentralized finance, property transfers, central bank fiat crypto (e.g., Fedcoin and China’s digital Renminbi), dispensing prescription drugs, private records, intellectual property, financial reporting, and media and advertising, to name a few.  The goals of the course are to: (i) provide an advanced understanding of the various blockchain technologies (ii) determine the specific business situations where blockchain technology can be deployed to solve important problems (iii) select the specific blockchain technology that has the best chance of success for a particular problem and (iv) detail the risks presented by this new technology. Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish, Japanese Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish, Japanese Duke University has about 13,000 undergraduate and graduate students and a world-class faculty helping to expand the frontiers of knowledge. The university has a strong commitment to applying knowledge in service to society, both near its North Carolina campus and around the world. A helicopter tour of the essential concepts of blockchain - each of which will be detailed later in the course. Blockchain as a technology is defined in terms of the commonalities present in blockchain applications. There is also an introduction to both current and future blockchain applications.  Almost all blockchains use some sort of cryptographic hashing. Hashing is a one way function where any input of arbitrary size can be uniquely expressed as a string of characters. Any change in the input cause the hash to change. Hashing is a one way function: it is easy to go from the input to the hash but extremely difficult to go the other way. As such, cryptographic hashing should not be confused with encryption where an encrypted message can be decoded.  Some basic knowledge of encryption techniques is essential for understanding blockchain technology. This module focuses on digital signature algorithms. When a transaction is placed on a blockchain, it is signed by the owner. With the owner’s public information and the signature, we can quickly determine if the signer is really the owner. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and the first large scale use of blockchain technology. This module explores how the bitcoin blockchain works. We detail the mechanics of transactions and there is an introduction to the consensus mechanism called Proof of Work. This provides a foundation to look at other blockchain implementations. We highlight the difference between bitcoin, ethereum and other technologies like Hyperledger. With a knowledge of the mechanics of blockchain technology, students are now able to determine the usefulness of the technology in various different applications. We focus on both the current applications as well as applications that are in process but not yet public.  There is no single blockchain technology and there are many ways to implement blockchain technology. The choice of technology crucially depends on the application. In this module, we study Proof of Work, Proof of Stake as well as some other mechanisms. Consensus is an active area of research in the blockchain space. There are thousands of new ventures that are deploying blockchain technology. How do we assess whether these ventures are viable - in the context of either investing for one of these companies or working for them. This module provides a checklist for evaluating cryptoventures. This list includes important questions such as: a) what problem is being solved? b) is the problem an important problem? c) is blockchain the best technology to solve the problem? and d) what type of blockchain technology is best suited to solve the problem?  Given this is a new technology, regulators need to both learn about the technology and develop guidelines. The module explores some key regulators in the US such as the SEC and the CFTC and the basic legal background that guides their regulatory framework. We also explore the regulatory concept of the “right touch”: if the regulations are too harsh, then innovation is stifled and driven off shore - if regulations are too lax, then you invite a high level of fraud. The module ends with a general discussion of the future of Fintech, in particular, decentralized finance.  From entrepreneurs to executives, this Specialization provides an opportunity for you to learn how to advance business innovation in your company and gain insights from leading faculty in the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University. In the first course, you will learn how to valuate entrepreneurial ventures—including high-growth startups—using Excel spreadsheet models. You will also learn how to discern between the tradeoffs of different financing strategies: loan investments, venture capital, angel investing, and crowdfunding.  The second course will teach you how to manage a startup’s financing strategy, where you will learn how to build capitalization tables (or “cap tables”) in Excel. Cap tables will help you explore different financing strategies for your startup company and determine which financing decisions are best for your entrepreneurial venture.  The third course transitions to an analysis of blockchain technologies, where you will learn how to identify opportunities to disrupt and innovate business models using blockchain as well as avoid poorly executed applications of blockchain to business.  The fourth course will teach you how to use R programming to calculate the return of a stock portfolio as well as quantify the market risk of that portfolio.  This Specialization is also an excellent opportunity for professionals interested in Fuqua’s master’s programs to get an inside look into Fuqua’s faculty expertise and courses. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:39h:1|2;Algorithms

Welcome to this course on going from Basics to Mastery of TensorFlow. We're excited you're here! In week 1 you'll get a soft introduction to what Machine Learning and Deep Learning are, and how they offer you a new programming paradigm, giving you a new set of tools to open previously unexplored scenarios. All you need to know is some very basic programming skills, and you'll pick the rest up as you go along. You'll be working with code that works well across both TensorFlow 1.x and the TensorFlow 2.0 alpha.   To get started, check out the first video, a conversation between Andrew and Laurence that sets the theme for what you'll study... Welcome to week 2 of the course! In week 1 you learned all about how Machine Learning and Deep Learning is a new programming paradigm. This week you’re going to take that to the next level by beginning to solve problems of computer vision with just a few lines of code!  Check out this conversation between Laurence and Andrew where they discuss it and introduce you to Computer Vision! Welcome to week 3! In week 2 you saw a basic Neural Network for Computer Vision. It did the job nicely, but it was a little naive in its approach. This week we’ll see how to make it better, as discussed by Laurence and Andrew here.  Last week you saw how to improve the results from your deep neural network using convolutions. It was a good start, but the data you used was very basic. What happens when your images are larger, or if the features aren’t always in the same place? Andrew and Laurence discuss this to prepare you for what you’ll learn this week: handling complex images!

This Specialization will teach you best practices for using TensorFlow, a popular open-source framework for machine learning. In Course 3 of the deeplearning.ai TensorFlow Specialization, you will build natural language processing systems using TensorFlow. You will learn to process text, including tokenizing and representing sentences as vectors, so that they can be input to a neural network. You’ll also learn to apply RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs in TensorFlow. Finally, you’ll get to train an  LSTM on existing text to create original poetry!  The Machine Learning course and Deep Learning Specialization from Andrew Ng teach the most important and foundational principles of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. This new deeplearning.ai TensorFlow Specialization teaches you how to use TensorFlow to implement those principles so that you can start building and applying scalable models to real-world problems.

The first step in understanding sentiment in text, and in particular when training a neural network to do so is the tokenization of that text. This is the process of converting the text into numeric values, with a number representing a word or a character. This week you'll learn about the Tokenizer and pad_sequences APIs in TensorFlow and how they can be used to prepare and encode text and sentences to get them ready for training neural networks! Last week you saw how to use the Tokenizer to prepare your text to be used by a neural network by converting words into numeric tokens, and sequencing sentences from these tokens. This week you'll learn about Embeddings, where these tokens are mapped as vectors in a high dimension space. With Embeddings and labelled examples, these vectors can then be tuned so that words with similar meaning will have a similar direction in the vector space. This will begin the process of training a neural network to understand sentiment in text -- and you'll begin by looking at movie reviews, training a neural network on texts that are labelled 'positive' or 'negative' and determining which words in a sentence drive those meanings. In the last couple of weeks you looked first at Tokenizing words to get numeric values from them, and then using Embeddings to group words of similar meaning depending on how they were labelled. This gave you a good, but rough, sentiment analysis -- words such as 'fun' and 'entertaining' might show up in a positive movie review, and 'boring' and 'dull' might show up in a negative one. But sentiment can also be determined by the sequence in which words appear. For example, you could have 'not fun', which of course is the opposite of 'fun'. This week you'll start digging into a variety of model formats that are used in training models to understand context in sequence! Taking everything that you've learned in training a neural network based on NLP, we thought it might be a bit of fun to turn the tables away from classification and use your knowledge for prediction. Given a body of words, you could conceivably predict the word most likely to follow a given word or phrase, and once you've done that, to do it again, and again. With that in mind, this week you'll build a poetry generator. It's trained with the lyrics from traditional Irish songs, and can be used to produce beautiful-sounding verse of it's own!

A member of the Ivy League, Penn is the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, and considers itself to be the first university in the United States with both undergraduate and graduate studies.  To learn a foreign language like Accounting, you need quite a bit of practice in the basic foundations (grammar, syntax, idioms, etc.).  This material is absolutely essential for being able to read and to understand books written in the language (in our case, financial statements.). This week, we will start building these foundations.  We will start with an overview of financial reporting.  What types of reports are required?  Who makes the rules? Who enforces the rules?  Then, we will cover the balance sheet equation and define/discuss Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholders' Equity.  We will introduce debit-credit bookkeeping and do lots of practice in translating transactions into debits and credits. Finally, we will introduce a case of a start-up company to provide you insights into all of the steps necessary to go from recording the first transactions of a new business all the way through its first set of financial statements. We will start with a discussion of Accrual Accounting and how it affects the recognition of the Income Statement accounts: Revenues and Expenses.  Then, we will cover adjusting entries, which are needed to prepare our internal books for the upcoming financial statements.  Finally, we will discuss closing entries and the preparation of the Balance Sheet and Income Statement. At each stage, we will continue to work on the case of our start-up company. If you are not sick and tired of journal entries by the end of this week, then I have not done my job!   Cash is King!  We will start with the classification of cash flows into operating, investing, and financing activities.  Then, we will work on preparing and analyzing the Statement of Cash Flows.  We will wrap up the case on the start-up company by preparing and analyzing its Statement of Cash Flows.  Finally, we will discuss the differences between Earnings, Cash from Operations, EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow. We will have our final exam this week.  Because of the exam, I will cover Ratio Analysis, which will not involve any new material.  While we will define and discuss a number of ratios, they will all basically involve dividing one accounting number by another.  But, the analysis of what those ratios mean will involve a deep understanding of Balance Sheet and Income Statement accounts.  Thus, the Ratio Analysis videos will help provide a nice review of the material, which will help you prepare for the exam.  However, there will be no questions about ratio analysis on the exam.  The only thing left to do after this exam is to impress your family, friends, and co-workers with your vast knowledge of Financial Accounting! ;10;1;1;Długość kursu:48h:1|2;Java

What is your dog expressing when he yawns or wags his tail? Understanding your cat and dog’s behaviour and the way they communicate with you, will enable you to better understand their needs and strengthen your relationship with them. This MOOC is divided into five topics, the appliance of science behaviour and body language, senses and perception challenges for the human-animal relationship, including pet problem behaviour and how to improve the quality of life for cats and dogs in our care.  At the start of the course we ask you to consider what you feel is important to your cat/dog and what your cat/dog means to you? We explore the world of cats and dogs and how our relationships with them vary around the world and have changed over time. We ask if we can really know what our animals are thinking or trying to communicate through their facial expressions and behaviours.    From our beloved pets to street dogs, shelter dogs/cats and welfare challenges, we explore the world from their perspective and examine how their genetic make-up may influence their behavioural responses and choices. We dispel common behavioural myths by looking through a scientific lens, asking questions about the function and development of their behaviour.. We explore how their senses help them to interact with their world and how they communicate with each other and us!  Finally, we ask whether we impose unrealistic expectations on our cats and dogs and how this affects their ability to live alongside us. We ask, what can we do to be more responsible pet owners and to ensure the welfare of all cats and dogs in society? This MOOC explores different scientifically validated methods that can help you to better understand your pet, to enrich their lives and help you to be a more educated and confident pet owner.  We hope you enjoy the course!

Ranked 20th in the world, we have been an international leader in online learning since our first online degree launched in 2005. As part of our commitment to making learning accessible to all, we offer free courses in a variety of subjects including philosophy, health, animal welfare and STEM courses, all designed to build the skills of the global community.  Join our 3.6 million learners to expand your knowledge or boost your career. In week 1, we provide 'an insight into cats and dogs behaviour: through their eyes'. We will explore cats and dogs of the world and ask you what you cat and dog mean to you, as well as what you feel is important to your cat and dog. At the end of the week, you will be able to complete the first of the graded quizzes. We hope you enjoy the MOOC as much as we have enjoyed making it! In week 2, we will we explore ethology, which is the scientific and objective study of non-human animal behaviour, rather than human behaviour, and usually with a focus on behaviour under natural conditions. There will also be an opportunity to look at different breeds of cats and dogs and some of the possible issues that arise from breeding. At the end of the week, you will be able to complete the second of the graded quizzes. In week 3, we aim to explore cat and dog sensory capabilities and how they interact with their world. We will explore how our cats and dogs communicate with us and each other. We will also examine how their specific senses work and how they use these to operate effectively such as to solve problems, hunt, and play. At the end of the week, you will be able to complete the third of the graded quizzes. In week 4, we explore the domestic environment and how our cats and dogs adjust to this (or not). We will also discuss what behaviours may arise due to the unrealistic expectations that we may impose on our pets. The videos this week, will help you recognise the signs of fear, frustration, and anxiety, as well as other behavioural problems in cats and dogs. At the end of the week, you will be able to complete the fourth graded quiz. In the final week of the course we want to reflect on what we have learned so far and start to consider how we can make changes. In doing so, improving our beloved cats and dogs lives for the better, for example through enriching their environment, training, and appropriate care at all stages of their lives (from kittens/puppies through to old age). At the end of the week, you will be able to complete the fifth and final of the graded quizzes. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:14h:1|2;Java

How can I tell whether one design works better than another? This course will teach you fundamental principles of design and how to effectively evaluate your work with users. You'll learn fundamental principles of visual design so that you can effectively organize and present information with your interfaces. You'll learn principles of perception and cognition that inform effective interaction design. And you'll learn how to perform and analyze controlled experiments online. In many cases, we'll use Web design as the anchoring domain. A lot of the examples will come from the Web, and we'll talk just a bit about Web technologies in particular. When we do so, it will be to support the main goal of this course, which is helping you build human-centered design skills, so that you have the principles and methods to create excellent interfaces with any technology. Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Chinese (Simplified), Italian, Portuguese (Brazilian), Vietnamese, German, Russian, Turkish, English, Spanish, Japanese Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Chinese (Simplified), Italian, Portuguese (Brazilian), Vietnamese, German, Russian, Turkish, English, Spanish, Japanese UC San Diego is an academic powerhouse and economic engine, recognized as one of the top 10 public universities by U.S. News and World Report. Innovation is central to who we are and what we do. Here, students learn that knowledge isn't just acquired in the classroom—life is their laboratory. Welcome to the course! Here are some helpful resources to guide you through this course. Our lecture videos in this module begin with the major innovation of the graphical interface: enabling people to perform input directly on top of output. This directness makes interfaces easier to learn because it enables people to recognize familiar elements. And continuous feedback makes interfaces easier to use, encourages exploration, and prevents errors. To illustrate the benefits of direct manipulation in real interfaces, the videos provide several examples of both particular designs and interface styles. I find that's a lot more useful than just stating abstract principles. Now is a good time to remind everyone that I am not endorsing (or rejecting) any particular product, organization, or person. What I am doing: real people in the real world make real design decisions -- you can learn from this -- and in this course I'll discuss these concrete examples so you can gain real knowledge. The rest of the videos will cover topics related to the importance of representations, such as understanding a user's mental model and helping people to distribute cognition. I will show some examples of how representational differences can impact performance. As you watch these videos, think about how you have arranged or lamented representations in your everyday life. Maybe you put your keys by the door, sunglasses on your hat, or a post-it on your laptop? You'll get a chance to delve into these examples in the assignment. So far, many examples in our videos have been physical. I like physical examples because they’re often easier to understand, and they durably express fundamental principles. Equipped with those fundamentals, we'll now focus more on concrete issues in interaction design to help you flesh out your interactive prototypes. This module’s videos introduce visual and information design. These are the nuts and bolts of user interfaces: scale, contrast, pattern, shape, color, typography, and layout. What I hope you'll take away from these lectures is a newfound appreciation for how subtle changes in this visual variables can powerfully impact people's experience of documents and interfaces. Dive into the first visual design lecture here. Visual design organizes the world of information. As this module’s lectures show, that visual organization provides important cues, yet the structure itself is often invisible. After you’ve made a design, how do you know whether it is good? Or if your team has a couple ideas it is considering, how do you know which one is better? Rather than arguing, throwing chairs, or playing rochambeau, we suggest getting your designs in front of real users to see how well they actually work. To enable you to do this, our final module of lectures will introduce you to designing, running, and analyzing experiments. Testing your ideas with people and using what you learn to make them better can often mean the difference between a flop and a hit. Usability testing also gives you a chance to flex your rapid prototyping muscles. Build several interfaces quickly, try them out with people, and use what you learn to revise them. Through repeated iteration and testing, you can end up with a wonderfully polished interface. For me, the most exhilarating aspect of running experiments is the element of surprise. Nearly every time my students, colleagues, and I run a study, we learn something that we never even thought to think of. Sometimes, it's a roadblock or bug. Other times, it's an unexpected new use of a system -- many great startups have emerged out of finding unexpected new uses for technology. Either way, it'll give you new fodder for design. As in the prototyping lectures, the evaluation lectures emphasize comparison -- testing multiple ideas. In many ways, design is choice, and comparing multiple interfaces helps you make good choices. Learn more about designing studies here. You will learn how to design technologies that bring people joy, rather than frustration. You'll learn how to generate design ideas, techniques for quickly prototyping them, and how to use prototypes to get feedback from other stakeholders like your teammates, clients, and users. You'll also learn principles of visual design, perception, and cognition that inform effective interaction design. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:24h:1|2;Java

To address these public health crises, we urgently need to explore innovative strategies for promoting healthful eating. There is strong evidence that global increases in the consumption of heavily processed foods, coupled with cultural shifts away from the preparation of food in the home, have contributed to high rates of preventable, chronic disease. In this course, learners will be given the information and practical skills they need to begin optimizing the way they eat. This course will shift the focus away from reductionist discussions about nutrients and move, instead, towards practical discussions about real food and the environment in which we consume it. By the end of this course, learners should have the tools they need to distinguish between foods that will support their health and those that threaten it. In addition, we will present a compelling rationale for a return to simple home cooking, an integral part of our efforts to live longer, healthier lives.

In this section we will examine the social and cultural shifts that have contributed to our modern epidemics of overweight and obesity. We will briefly review the nutrients found in foods, their different functions in the human body and how we can support our own health by choosing wisely from the foods within each category. In this section, we will explore the ways in which highly processed foods differ from real, whole food and the implications of food processing on our health. We’ll also look at how our consumption of sugar has changed in recent decades and explore sensible solutions for people who wish to start eating better. We will also meet Kevin, a middle-aged pre-diabetic man, and find out how a step-wise approach to behavior change helped him change for the better. This section focuses on sustainable solutions to the challenge of choosing healthier foods more frequently. Michael Pollan explains his mantra and how we can use it to make better food choices. We also begin to explore practical tips for preparing foods that will support our health and enjoyment. In this section you will find more practical tips for grocery shopping, reading labels and assembling a balanced meal. We also learn more about the most important secret ingredient for success: moderation. A few years ago, a friend of mine started a healthy eating and fitness website called Grokker.

Mécanique du Solide Indéformable  Cette partie traite la mécanique du solide indéformable. Dans certains établissements, cette matière est vue avec une application des torseurs. Aussi, nous avons inclus dans cette partie un supplément de formation sur ce sujet. Deux leçons introduisent  les torseurs. Le cours de mécanique se poursuit alors avec l'option de voir comment la matière présentée par le prof. Ansermet peut aussi être appréhendée avec l'usage des torseurs. Ces compléments ont été préparés par le Prof. Paul Salmon Ngohé Ekam de l'Ecole Nationale Supérieure Polytechnique de Yaoundé, Cameroun.

On arrive à des résultats fondamentaux pour tout problème de mécanique et on les appliquera dans la suite de ce MOOC au cas particulier du solide indéformable. Ceux qui n'auraient pas suivi les deux parties précédentes peuvent rapidement prendre connaissance de nos conventions de notation en regardant les modules placés au début de cette leçon. Ceux qui souhaitent se familiariser avec l'usage des torseurs devront suivre aussi les leçons 17.A et 17.B. Nous vous recommandons de consacrer une semaine à chacune de ces deux leçons complémentaires.  La mécanique du point matériel avait nécessité tout un appareillage pour décrire sa position, sa vitesse et son accélération. Pour le solide, il en va de même, il faut se donner les moyens de décrire la position et l'orientation d'un solide. De plus, on doit pouvoir déterminer la vitesse et l'accélération de tout point du solide.  Nous appliquons ici les lois de la dynamique que nous avons établies pour tout système de point matériel. Une difficulté particulière est traitée ici dans le contexte de la dynamique du solide indéformable : celle de savoir comment le moment cinétique change quand on change le point de référence par rapport auquel on définit le moment cinétique. Cette question est reprise par le prof. Ekam avec le formalisme des torseurs.  Cette leçon et la suivante présente des applications de la dynamique du solide. On commence ici avec un solide dont un axe est d'orientation fixe, par exemple le pendule physique.  Dans cette leçon, on examine la dynamique d'un solide dans un mouvement tout à fait général. On commence par dériver les équations du mouvement dites équations d'Euler. Le deuxième module discute les effets gyroscopiques de façon qualitative. La statique des solides indéformables est ensuite traitée avec les torseurs. ;10;1;1;Długość kursu:17h:1|2;Java

Este curso es el segundo del programa especializado: Liderazgo Efectivo para el Siglo XXI. Cerraste el módulo pasado conectándote con cosas que son muy valiosas para ti y que tienen que ver con tu propósito de vida. En este módulo vamos a acompañarte en un proceso de trabajo y descubrimiento personal. Lo vamos a hacer con la ayuda de una herramienta llamada la Espiral de Autoliderazgo Consciente (EAC). La espiral busca que identifiques un tema muy importante para ti de trabajo personal y que vayas más allá de planear un proceso de transformación como si se tratara de un problema técnico, es decir, un problema que se puede resolver con un estilo de autoliderazgo heróico: en el que para avanzar requieres algo de conocimiento nuevo, quizá contratar a algún experto que te ayude a tomar una decisión que vas a mantener por fuerza de voluntad. La espiral te puede ayudar a comprender las creencias y obstáculos emocionales que dificultan tu proceso. Te vamos a acompañar a hacer un diagnóstico, a planear y ejecutar intervenciones para que tengas un mayor conocimiento de ti, aumentes tus probabilidades de éxito y aprendas con el proceso. ¡Hola! Bienvenidos al tercer módulo del curso Autoliderazgo y gestión de emociones para avanzar en desafíos complejos. En este módulo y en el siguiente vamos a practicar herramientas que te ayudarán a ser más consciente de ti y de tus emociones, lo cual te dará mayor poder de actuar y de autoregulación. Estas herramientas te serán útiles para  afrontar dos tipos de malestares emocionales: a) el malestar que te generan las emociones que te secuestran inesperadamente y te desconectan del presente,  y b) el malestar que te genera a veces saber que debes enfrentar una situación exigente y tienes  la sensación de no ser capaz de afrontarla de una manera calmada y efectiva. ¡Descúbrelas! ¡Bienvenidos al cuarto módulo del curso Autoliderazgo y gestión de emociones para avanzar en desafíos complejos! En este módulo vamos a continuar la exploración y práctica que empezamos en el módulo 3, cuyo objetivo es ayudarte a tener mejores herramientas para lidiar con malestares emocionales y convertir tus emociones en el motor inteligente que pueden ser para ti.

Cuando la gente intenta concertar una definición, hay una tendencia general a recurrir al modelo heroico del liderazgo, de un hombre con características especiales y en un puesto directivo que convence a otros de seguirlo hacia su visión. Este modelo es atractivo, pero limitado y obsoleto para la mayoría de los desafíos que nos importan hoy en día. El “modelo heroico” suele ser muy útil para solucionar problemas que no requieren cambios en las personas involucradas en solucionarlos, pero es menos útil o incluso factible para progresar en la solución de problemas difíciles de definir, en situaciones en que hay mucha incertidumbre, y cuando parte importante del problema son las decisiones hábitos y miedos de la propia gente (tú incluida/o) que necesita trabajar para llegar a la solución. En este curso vamos a preguntarnos ¿qué concepción de liderazgo y qué tipo de habilidades son útiles para el complejo y cambiante mundo en el que vivimos?, ¿cómo se aprenden estas habilidades?, ¿para qué tipo de desafíos es necesario el liderazgo?, ¿qué recursos de poder y formas de autoridad hacen parte del liderazgo y cuáles no?, ¿qué riesgos tiene la práctica del liderazgo?, ¿cómo te proteges?.   Vamos a invitarte a que, en el espacio virtual y en tu vida real, adquieras una perspectiva potente, unas “Gafas Efectivas” para mirar el mundo complejo en el que vives, diagnosticar los desafíos que te importan y planear intervenciones para avanzar en ellos. En otras palabras, el curso te acompaña en el proceso de adueñarte de una metodología de diagnóstico e intervención, que llamamos Espiral de Liderazgo Consciente, que te va ayudar a identificar y caracterizar:  1. Tus propósitos 2. Los desafíos y oportunidades que enfrentas para llegar a ellos 3. Los aspectos técnicos de estos desafíos/oportunidades, que tienen que ver con reglas, dinero, conocimiento, expertos y autoridades formales 4. Los aspectos humanos y sistémicos de estos desafíos/oportunidades: que tienen que ver con las personas interesadas y afectadas, sus valores, miedos, las facciones que forman y a veces pelean entre sí, la probabilidad de que sean aliados o detractores 5. Tus recursos formales e informales (y desafíos internos) que afectan el tema que quieres avanzar, y los riesgos del liderazgo que probablemente enfrentarás  Todo ello para que planees intervenciones y experimentos de avance, y reflexiones sobre cómo protegerte (pensando en el sistema, haciendo alianzas, reflexionando en la acción, escuchando a las facciones, gestionando tus emociones, etc)   Vamos a invitarte también a observar y profundizar tu habilidad para estar presente y para reflexionar y aprender antes, durante y después de hacer alguna intervención dirigida a mejorar tus resultados personales o de grupo. En otras palabras, vamos a acompañarte a profundizar en tres herramientas que llamamos “Estoy Aquí”  “Subir al Balcón” y “Parada para respirar” que tienen que ver con meta-observar al mundo, a ti mismo en el mundo y a tu mundo interior y encontrar la respuesta a preguntas como: ¿cómo te sientes cuando estás intensamente presente en una actividad (o en un sistema en el que quieres intervenir para cambiar los resultados)?, ¿cuáles son los mecanismos por los que se dispersa tu atención y las justificaciones que te das a ti mismo para dejar de estar presente?, ¿qué está pasando en el mundo externo?, ¿qué está pasando en tu interior?.   Estos objetivos de aprendizaje implican que el curso al que vas a entrar no está diseñado de forma convencional, como clases magistrales en las que un experto te “enseña” conceptos, sino que el rol de los profesores en este curso es el de diseñar oportunidades de aprendizaje para ti, y acompañarte a que reflexiones sobre ellas.

En este primer módulo queremos que reconozcas el modelo mental que tienes sobre autoridad, poder y liderazgo y darte la oportunidad de adquirir herramientas para observar el mundo de forma efectiva, de modo que seas capaz de entender cómo moverte y energizar a otros para  avanzar en temas importantes. Las herramientas que se trabajan en este módulo son: herramientas de diagnóstico, herramientas de meta observación (subirse al balcón, parada para respirar) y herramientas de meta reflexión (la ética del cuidado). El mundo de hoy es un mundo complejo y el estilo más eficaz con frecuencia es diferente al modelo clásico de un hombre heroico que tiene seguidores que lo apoyan en el cumplimiento de metas. Vamos en este módulo a explorar cómo identificar diferentes tipos de desafíos y sus componentes y cómo pensar en el tema de estilos de liderazgo de una forma moderna y útil para avanzar en los temas que nos importan. ¡Bienvenido! Los dos estilos de Liderazgo de los que hablamos en el módulo 2 son riesgosos. El “liderazgo heroico” se encarga de una parte más que proporcional de la responsabilidad de resolver los desafíos. Eso lleva a que se resuelvan solamente los aspectos técnicos de los problemas, a que otros le echen la culpa al “Líder” de las limitaciones en la solución y lleva a que la gente se desconecte de su brújula ética y sea capaz de hacer cosas feas. El “liderazgo humano” cuando es efectivo, ayuda a personas a comprometerse con ser parte de la solución de desafíos complejos. “Ser parte de la solución” puede implicar que la gente tiene que cambiar algunas creencias,  hábitos y ¡hasta de amigos!  Con frecuencia la gente tiene mucho miedo a las pérdidas que asocia con estos cambios y eso genera muchos riesgos a quien intenta hacer que esta gente se haga responsable de su parte del problema. Un riesgo al que te expones al usar cualquiera de los dos estilos de liderazgo es que no identifiques el sistema y las posibles amenazas que pueden surgir. La forma de protegerse es, entre otras cosas, “subirse al balcón” y reflexionar sobre el sistema humano afectado ¡Navega este módulo si quieres descubrir más cosas sobre los riesgos del liderazgo y cómo protegerte! ¡Bienvenido al módulo 4! Cuando identificas un tema que te importa o una realidad que quieres transformar, ¿qué herramientas usas para entenderla mejor, para diagnosticar la brecha que hay entre lo que ves y lo que quisieras ver, y para prepararte para los desafíos y riesgos que tendrás que enfrentar?.

The course offers a brand workout for your own brands, as well as guest videos from leading branding professionals.  The aim of the course is to change the conception of brands as being an organisation's visual identity (e.g., logo) and image (customers' brand associations) to an experience along moments-that-matter along the customer journey and, therefore, delivered by people across the entire organisation. Brands are thus not only an external promise to customers, but a means of executing business strategy via internal brand-led behaviour and culture change.  You will learn and practice the following skills:  1. How to build brands from a broad organisational perspective  2. How to lead brand-led culture change with human resource practices at the core (i.e., brand as a lever and not just an outcome)  3. How to build brands in multi-brand companies, across cultures and geographies 4. How to measure brand health in new ways, that is, internally in addition to externally 5. How to value and capture returns to brands across the organisation - introducing the new concept of employee-based brand equity - and how this is different from the valuation of brands as intangible assets.   This course allows you to develop the following aspects of yourself:  1. Head. Gain a deeper understanding of the evolving practice of brand management, one that goes further than practiced in most organisations today 2. Heart. Be motivated to engage in delivering your own brands – regardless of where you are in your organisation – thereby creating superior value for customers and for your organisation 3. Hands.

Maybe you’d talk to a customer somewhere in there and they’d tell you what features they wanted. But companies that manage product that way are dying. Being a product person today is a new game, and product managers are at the center of it. Today, particularly if your product is mostly digital, you might update it several times a day. Massive troves of data are available for making decisions and, at the same time, deep insights into customer motivation and experience are more important than ever. The job of the modern product manager is to charter a direction and create a successful working environment for all the actors involved in product success.  It’s not a simple job or an easy job, but it is a meaningful job where you’ll be learning all the time.   This course will help you along your learning journey and prepare you with the skills and perspective you need to:  Create the actionable focus to successfully manage your product (week 1) Focus your work using modern product management methods (week 2) Manage new products and explore new product ideas (week 3) Manage and amplify existing products (week 4)  This course is ideal for current product or general  managers interested in today's modern product management methods.

Founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, the University is guided by his vision of discovery, innovation, and development of the full potential of students from all walks of life. Through these courses, global learners have an opportunity to study with renowned scholars and thought leaders. As a product manager, you and your team will always have more ideas and more requests than you can possibly manage. Making matters still more complicated, part of your job is to develop and then ‘sell’ a particular view of what should happen with your product to diverse stakeholders (engineering, marketing, etc.). How do you do it? Success requires an actionable, testable focus. The successful product manager identifies vivid, testable customer outcomes and creates focus around them. This week we’ll show you how to interface effectively with all your stakeholders to create that actionable focus. You’ve probably heard that the days of ‘build it and they will come’ are over. But what exactly should you be doing instead? There’s no shortage of material out there on how to be innovative--but you only have so much time. This week we’ll step through the method’s today’s most successful product managers are using and give you tips to “sell” those methods to your stakeholders. We’ll also show you how to analyze growth, engagement and monetization using qualitative and quantitative methods. You’ll finish the week with an understanding of which methods to apply when and hear from practitioners who are using these methods to make breakthrough products.  Something on the order of 9 out of 10 new products fail. Those sound like daunting odds, but through disciplined exploration an effective PM knows how to make even the improbable probable. This week we’ll show you how to apply your understanding of modern PM methods to exploring new product ideas.  We’ll step through customer discovery, idea testing/validation, early development, and business model design. By the end you’ll have a durable process you can both execute and communicate to your team. If you want a product that does more than make a big splash, you’ll need to apply what you’ve learned here every week, every sprint to keep that product fresh and relevant. It’s not hard to let a great product get sidetracked and become irrelevant to its users--this happens all the time. Some figures show the portion of features on successful products that are regularly used to be well under 50%. Yikes! In this week, we’ll look at how successful product managers keep their products fresh and focused on valuable outcomes for their users. You’ll learn how to put a focused, sustainable, program in place to keep your product competitive.  ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:49h:1|2;Java

In week 1 readings, we focus on learning abbreviations related to vital signs. Understanding the structure of abbreviations will help you to identify the meaning of abbreviations presented in this course, as well as those you encounter in the future. In week 2, we expand our focus to learn about abbreviations and terms used in the hospital environment.  You will tour a modern U.S. clinical unit and visit the bedside of three patients. These vicarious bedside experiences will help you to imagine the context in which the terms and abbreviations are used.  Making associations of the terms or abbreviations to specific people, places or types of patients will help to “set” them in your memory. Begin Week 2 by previewing the complex medical terms you will find in this lesson and sharpening your skills for analyzing the structure of complex terms.   This week, Dr. Swigart shares more strategies toward discovering the meaning of complex medical/scientific words. It focuses on three essential clinical topics: abbreviations used in emergency situations, the timing and route of medications, and the administration of intravenous infusions.  Learning about abbreviations related to medication and intravenous fluid administration requires that you pay close attention. This week turns the focus to the acronyms commonly substituted for the name of diseases and conditions of the bodily systems. To help you relate the disease and its acronym, we have organized the diseases according to systems of the body. First letters of words or syllables usually form the acronym, and commonly at least one letter relates to a system of the body. This week, the lecture focuses on the important aspects of patient safety when using abbreviations. The readings focus on laboratory tests and diagnostic procedures. A patient-case approach is used to help you make associations between diseases and the tests or procedures typically required. As you worked through Week 1-5 sessions you have learned about abbreviations and terms used every day in clinical practice. Now you are ready to use your new knowledge and test your comprehension skills. This week you see and hear clinical conversation in reality-based video simulations. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:34h:1|2;Java

So this isn’t a comprehensive statistics course - rather it offers a practical orientation to the field of medical research and commonly used statistical analysis. The first topics we will look at are research methods and data collection with a specific focus on study types. By the end, you should be able to identify which study types are being used and why the researchers selected them, when you are later reading a published paper. We finally get started with the statistics. Have you ever looked at the methods and results section of any healthcare research publication and noted the variety of statistical tests used?  You would have come across terms like t-test, Mann-Whitney-U test, Wilcoxon test, Fisher’s exact test, and the ubiquitous chi-squared test.  Why so many tests you might wonder?  It’s all about types of data.  This week  I am going to tackle the differences in data that determine what type of statistical test we can use in making sense of our data. There is hardly any healthcare professional who is unfamiliar with the p-value.  It is usually understood to have a watershed value of 0.05.  If a research question is evaluated through the collection of data points and statistical analysis reveals a value less that 0.05, we accept this a proof that some significant difference was found, at least statistically.In reality things are a bit more complicated than that.  The literature is currently full of questions about the ubiquitous p-vale and why it is not the panacea many of us have used it as. During this week you will develop an intuitive understanding of concept of a p-value. From there, I'll move on to the heart of probability theory, the Central Limit Theorem and data distribution. In general, a researcher has a question in mind that he or she needs to answer. Everyone might have an opinion on this question (or answer), but a researcher looks for the answer by designing an experiment and investigating the outcome. First, we will look at hypotheses and how they relate to ethical and unbiased research and reporting. We'll also tackle confidence intervals which I believe are one of the least understood and often misrepresented values in healthcare research. The most common tests used in the literature to compare numerical data point values are t-tests, analysis of variance, and linear regression.  In the last lesson we take a closer look at these tests, but perhaps more importantly, their strict assumptions.  The most common statistical test that you might come across in the literature is the t-test.  There are, in actual fact, a few t-tests, but the one most are familiar with, is of course, Student’s t-test and its ubiquitous p-value.  Not everyone, though, knows that the name Student was actually a pseudonym, used by William Gosset (1876 - 1937).  Parametric tests have very strict assumptions that must be met before their use is justified.  In this lesson we take a closer look at these tests, but perhaps more importantly, their strict assumptions.  Once you know these, you will be able to identify when these tests are used inappropriately. Congratulations! You've reached the final week of the course Understanding Clinical Research. In this lesson we will take a look at how good tests are at picking up the presence or absence of disease, helping us choose appropriate tests, and how to interpret positive and negative results.  We’ll decipher sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values. You'll end of this course with a final exam, to test the knowledge and application you've learned in this course. I hope you've enjoyed this course and it helps your understanding of clinical research.  ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:44h:1|2;Java

Students are introduced to core programming concepts like data structures, conditionals, loops, variables, and functions.  This course includes an overview of the various tools available for writing and running Python, and gets students coding quickly.  It also provides hands-on coding exercises using commonly used data structures, writing custom functions, and reading and writing to files. This course may be more robust than some other introductory python courses, as it delves deeper into certain essential programming topics. Subtitles: English Subtitles: English The University of Pennsylvania (commonly referred to as Penn) is a private university, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. A member of the Ivy League, Penn is the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, and considers itself to be the first university in the United States with both undergraduate and graduate studies.  This first module covers an intro to programming and the Python language.  We’ll start by downloading and installing the necessary tools to begin programming and writing code in Python. After learning how to print to the console, we’ll get an understanding of Python’s basic data types, and how to do simple math. We’ll follow up by creating our first Python script, and learn how to define and assign variables, while controlling the flow of our program using conditionals. We’ll also learn how to get input from the user, including some very basic error checking. Let’s get started! We’ll start this module with a brief intro to lists, one of Python’s most commonly used data structures. We’ll learn just enough to get us started with loops, which are used to repeat a process or run a block of code multiple times. We’ll get into functions, which are blocks of organized code used to perform a single, related action. We’ll review some of Python’s built-in functions and learn how to design our own user-defined functions to use as building blocks in our own programs. Along the way, we’ll learn best practices for documenting our code for 2 different audiences: The users who are using our code and want to understand it at a high level, and the programmers who are reading it and want to know how it works. In this module, we’re going to start using PyCharm, another IDE for writing and running Python code.  It has enhanced features that go way beyond the limited functionality of IDLE, and it’s also an industry standard. After revisiting lists, including more advanced usage of the commonly used sequence, we’ll take a deep dive into two other very important data structures : sets and tuples.  We’ll learn how they can be leveraged to both store and manipulate information. And while we already have some experience working with strings, this module will explore the intricacies and more powerful functionality of strings. There are multiple ways of loading and storing data in Python.  Information can be saved in dictionaries, a data structure that is extremely useful for storing multiple attributes (or data points) about a single thing.  Data can also be stored in external files and then loaded into Python. This module will allow us to work with dictionaries in a variety of ways and to interact with the local file system by opening, reading from, and writing to, external files.  With these added skills, you’ll begin to get a better sense of the dynamic power of Python and how it can be easily integrated with other systems. This Specialization starts out by teaching basic concepts in Python and ramps up to more complex subjects such as object-oriented programming and data structures in Java. By the time learners complete this series of four courses, they will be able to write fully-functional programs in both Python and Java, two of the most well-known and frequently used programming languages in the world today. Introduction to Programming with Python and Java is for students and professionals who have minimal or no prior programming exposure. It’s for motivated learners who have experience with rigorous coursework, and are looking to gain a competitive edge in advancing their career. It’s for folks who are thinking about applying to the University of Pennsylvania’s online Master of Computer and Information Technology degree and want to sample some of the lecture videos and content from the first course in the program. We hope this Specialization is for you.  Topics in this Specialization include language syntax, style, programming techniques, and coding conventions. Learn about best practices and good code design, code testing and test-driven development, code debugging, code and program documentation, and computational thinking. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:43h:1|2;Java

In this course, Prof. Robert Heinsch, Dr. Giulia Pinzauti and Dr. Emma Irving will give you a deep insight into the rules that govern armed conflict, and aim to mitigate human suffering on the battlefield. You will explore the why and how of IHL, followed by the different types of conflict. In no time you will find out which rules apply to the civil war in Syria, the military intervention in Ukraine and the occupation of the West Bank. During this course, you will learn how hostilities should be waged: Which weapons can be used by combatants and other fighters? And, who should never be a target during military operations? We will also look into the concept of protected persons, and you will find out how IHL affords protection to the sick and wounded, medical personal, detainees, children, journalists and other persons who are not - or not anymore - fighting. At the end of this course, you are introduced to the different implementation and enforcement mechanisms that aim to increase respect for IHL. Here, you are invited to think critically whether IHL works!  Throughout this course you will benefit from a mix of theory and practice, which is at the heart of the vision and mandate of the Kalshoven-Gieskes Forum. You can participate for instance in an ongoing case study where drones are flying over the fictitious country Arfula, and detainees are locked up in tiny cells. Or, you can join our discussions about IHL success stories and the major IHL challenges we face today, with distinguished speakers from the International Committee of the Red Cross and US Naval War College! This course is free to join and to participate in. There is the possibility to get a verified certificate for the course, which is a paid option.

With these activities, the forum aims to create better protection and assistance for victims of war and more respect for humanity in armed conflict. It is great that you are joining us! In this course you will get a deep insight into the law that governs armed conflict. Before you start with “International Humanitarian Law in Theory and Practice”, we invite you to first take a look around the course content. As you will notice, this MOOC starts with an introduction module in order to help you study successfully in an online environment, and to familiarize you with international humanitarian law. If you encounter any difficulties while studying, please let us know in the forum. For technical difficulties or questions regarding the course certificate, you can always contact the Coursera Learner Helpdesk. We truly hope that you will enjoy this course. Good luck!  In the first week, we will introduce you to the basic concepts of IHL, its history and place in the international legal order. We will discuss two different areas of IHL, “Hague law” and “Geneva law” respectively, and its main legal instruments. At the end, we will look at armed conflict and the protection of war victims from a human rights law perspective, in an engaging discussion with Prof. Helen Duffy. In this second week, we will study the scope of application of IHL. IHL regulates armed conflict, and therefore we will start by exploring the two different types of armed conflicts: international and non-international armed conflicts (IACs and NIACs). We will also look at the different rules that apply to each type of conflict. In this module, we will furthermore discover special situations of conflict, like belligerent occupation, foreign intervention and NIAC-spill over, which can impact the character of a conflict. At the end of this week we will touch upon situations below the armed conflict threshold, and Prof. Robin Geiss will tell us all about the so-called “global war on terror”. In this week, we will look through the eyes of combatants and other fighters, and learn how military operations should be conducted. We will familiarize ourselves with the most important principles that need to be applied on the battlefield including those of distinction, proportionality, precautions and the prohibition of unnecessary suffering. We will discover that civilians who refrain from hostilities should never be targeted. At the end of this module we will see that IHL also sets limits to the weapons that can be used by combatants, and Prof. Michael Schmitt will share his viewpoint on whether armed drones and other modern technologies like cyber warfare are lawful under IHL.  In this module we will look through the eyes of sick and wounded soldiers, detainees, enemy civilians and vulnerable persons in conflict, including children and women. We will discover how IHL safeguards persons who are not - or not anymore - fighting. Together, we will find out that each person should be treated humanely that detainees should receive water and food and that young children should never be recruited by the military. At the end of this module, Vincent Bernard from the ICRC will discuss with us the biggest challenges to protect persons who refrain from fighting, and will give us an insight into various IHL success stories across the globe.  In this final module, we will look into the implementation and enforcement of IHL, which is crucial to increase respect for IHL. After discussing different enforcement methods, we will highlight two methods: Demands for compensation and criminal prosecutions. Here, we will learn how war victims can claim compensation and how States and International Courts and Tribunals can initiate criminal prosecutions for war crimes when serious violations of IHL have been committed. At the end of this module, Jeroen van den Boogaard from the Netherlands Defense Academy will explain what the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, as well as the military can do in order to make wars more humane. He will also inform us what everyone can do to increase respect for IHL.   ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:6h:1|2;Java

Through concrete data sets and easy to use software the course provides data science knowledge that can be applied directly to analyze and improve processes in a variety of domains. Data science is the profession of the future, because organizations that are unable to use (big) data in a smart way will not survive. It is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data analysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis. Process mining bridges the gap between traditional model-based process analysis (e.g., simulation and other business process management techniques) and data-centric analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining. Process mining seeks the confrontation between event data (i.e., observed behavior) and process models (hand-made or discovered automatically). This technology has become available only recently, but it can be applied to any type of operational processes (organizations and systems). Example applications include: analyzing treatment processes in hospitals, improving customer service processes in a multinational, understanding the browsing behavior of customers using booking site, analyzing failures of a baggage handling system, and improving the user interface of an X-ray machine. All of these applications have in common that dynamic behavior needs to be related to process models. Hence, we refer to this as data science in action.  The course explains the key analysis techniques in process mining. Participants will learn various process discovery algorithms. These can be used to automatically learn process models from raw event data. Various other process analysis techniques that use event data will be presented. Moreover, the course will provide easy-to-use software, real-life data sets, and practical skills to directly apply the theory in a variety of application domains.  This course starts with an overview of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision making and business process (re)design. Then the course focuses on process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The course is at an introductory level with various practical assignments.  The course covers the three main types of process mining.  1. The first type of process mining is discovery. A discovery technique takes an event log and produces a process model without using any a-priori information. An example is the Alpha-algorithm that takes an event log and produces a process model (a Petri net) explaining the behavior recorded in the log.  2. The second type of process mining is conformance. Here, an existing process model is compared with an event log of the same process. Conformance checking can be used to check if reality, as recorded in the log, conforms to the model and vice versa.  3. The third type of process mining is enhancement. Here, the idea is to extend or improve an existing process model using information about the actual process recorded in some event log. Whereas conformance checking measures the alignment between model and reality, this third type of process mining aims at changing or extending the a-priori model. An example is the extension of a process model with performance information, e.g., showing bottlenecks. Process mining techniques can be used in an offline, but also online setting. The latter is known as operational support. An example is the detection of non-conformance at the moment the deviation actually takes place. Another example is time prediction for running cases, i.e., given a partially executed case the remaining processing time is estimated based on historic information of similar cases.  Process mining provides not only a bridge between data mining and business process management it also helps to address the classical divide between business and IT. Evidence-based business process management based on process mining helps to create a common ground for business process improvement and information systems development.  The course uses many examples using real-life event logs to illustrate the concepts and algorithms. After taking this course, one is able to run process mining projects and have a good understanding of the Business Process Intelligence field.  After taking this course you should: - have a good understanding of Business Process Intelligence techniques (in particular process mining), - understand the role of Big Data in today’s society, - be able to relate process mining techniques to other analysis techniques such as simulation, business intelligence, data mining, machine learning, and verification, - be able to apply basic process discovery techniques to learn a process model from an event log (both manually and using tools), - be able to apply basic conformance checking techniques to compare event logs and process models (both manually and using tools), - be able to extend a process model with information extracted from the event log (e.g., show bottlenecks), - have a good understanding of the data needed to start a process mining project, - be able to characterize the questions that can be answered based on such event data, - explain how process mining can also be used for operational support (prediction and recommendation), and - be able to conduct process mining projects in a structured manner.

Our research meets the highest international standards of quality. We push the limits of science, which puts us at the forefront of rapidly emerging areas of research. This first module contains general course information (syllabus, grading information) as well as the first lectures introducing data mining and process mining. In this module we introduce process models and the key feature of process mining: discovering process models from event data. Now that you know the basics of process mining, it is time to dive a little bit deeper and show you other ways of discovering a process model from event data. In this module we conclude process discovery by discussing alternative approaches. We also introduce how to check the conformance of the event data and the process model. In this module we focus on enriching process models. We can for instance add the data aspect to process models, show bottlenecks on the process model and analyse the social aspects of the process. In this final module we discuss how process mining can be applied on running processes. We also address how to get the (right) event data, process mining software, and how to get from data to results. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:44h:1|2;Algorithms

You'll practice both consonant and vowel sounds. You’ll also learn about the things that give English its special “music,” such as how to stress the right syllable in a word, how to make your voice go up and down in a natural-sounding melody, and how to naturally connect sounds and words. Learning these things will help you speak more clearly and make sure that others can understand what you're saying. This course is useful for English language learners who want to improve pronunciation of American English for better communication. Note that access to all of the lectures and handouts are free to anyone, but the graded assignments and quizzes are only available in the paid version of the course. You will need to submit recordings of your own pronunciation for graded assignments. Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Subtitles: Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, English, Spanish Since 1965, the University of California, Irvine has combined the strengths of a major research university with the bounty of an incomparable Southern California location. UCI’s unyielding commitment to rigorous academics, cutting-edge research, and leadership and character development makes the campus a driving force for innovation and discovery that serves our local, national and global communities in many ways. In this course, you will learn about the consonant and vowel sounds of American English and practice some of the difficult sounds. You will also learn about and practice intonation and stress. Practicing these things will help you improve your pronunciation and make your speech easier for others to understand. In this first week, you will practice the consonant sounds of American English. Consonants are the sounds where the air coming up from your lungs meets some obstacles on the way. The first sounds in the words time, sand, and moon are consonants. After a quick quiz to find out which consonant sounds are the most difficult for you, you’ll practice some pairs of sounds that might be confusing and learn some tricks for telling them apart, and you’ll start to understand how your mouth moves when you say these sounds. This week, you’ll practice some tricky vowel sounds in American English. Vowels are sounds that come out of your mouth very smoothly, like the first sounds in apple, ocean, and out. Vowel sounds are very important for being understood in English. They’re the “heart” of each syllable, and they need to be said clearly to avoid misunderstanding. Our goal is to help you pronounce English in a way that can be easily understood by listeners in real life, and mastering vowel sounds is an important step toward that goal. Now let’s practice the vowel sounds of American English. This week, you’ll learn about some things that give English its special rhythm and melody. You’ll learn about syllables—the small chunks of sound that make up the “beats” in words—and word stress—the way some parts of words are emphasized more than others. You’ll also see how some words become shorter and weaker when we talk. Since these words are used very often in ordinary speaking, we can’t understand spoken English without them. Our goal this week is to help you use the music of English to communicate more effectively and to be understood more easily when you speak. Enjoy learning about the music of American English pronunciation. In this final week of the course, you'll look at a few more tricky points in American English pronunciation. First, you’ll learn about the different ways to pronounce the –s and –ed word endings, which have important grammatical meanings, and you’ll learn when to use each kind of pronunciation. Next, you’ll practice pronouncing numbers like 14 and 40, 15 and 50, 16 and 60 that can cause misunderstandings. You’ll also learn about the pronunciation of the words “can” and “can’t” –the difference between them might surprise you. Finally, you’ll practice some sound changes that happen when words come together in common spoken expressions like gonna for going to, wanna for want to, and shoulda for should have. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:19h:1|2;Java

We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one. Why do models make us better thinkers? Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians.  The models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life. Here's how the course will work. For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you'll receive a Course Certificate. If you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that's fine too. It's all free. And it's all here to help make you a better thinker!

In these lectures, I describe some of the reasons why a person would want to take a modeling course. These reasons fall into four broad categories: 1)To be an intelligent citizen of the world 2) To be a clearer thinker 3) To understand and use data 4) To better decide, strategize, and design. There are two readings for this section. These should be read either after the first video or at the completion of all of the videos.We now jump directly into some models. We contrast two types of models that explain a single phenomenon, namely that people tend to live and interact with people who look, think, and act like themselves. After an introductory lecture, we cover famous models by Schelling and Granovetter that cover these phenomena. We follows those with a fun model about standing ovations that I wrote with my friend John Miller. In this section, we explore the mysteries of aggregation, i.e. adding things up. We start by considering how numbers aggregate, focusing on the Central Limit Theorem. We then turn to adding up rules. We consider the Game of Life and one dimensional cellular automata models. Both models show how simple rules can combine to produce interesting phenomena. Last, we consider aggregating preferences. Here we see how individual preferences can be rational, but the aggregates need not be.There exist many great places on the web to read more about the Central Limit Theorem, the Binomial Distribution, Six Sigma, The Game of Life, and so on. I've included some links to get you started. The readings for cellular automata and for diverse preferences are short excerpts from my books Complex Adaptive Social Systems and The Difference Respectively. In this section, we study various ways that social scientists model people. We study and contrast three different models. The rational actor approach, behavioral models, and rule based models . These lectures provide context for many of the models that follow. There's no specific reading for these lectures though I mention several books on behavioral economics that you may want to consider. Also, if you find the race to the bottom game interesting just type Rosemary Nagel Race to the Bottom into a search engine and you'll get several good links. You can also find good introductions to Zero Intelligence Traders by typing that in as well. In this section, we cover tipping points. We focus on two models. A percolation model from physics that we apply to banks and a model of the spread of diseases. The disease model is more complicated so I break that into two parts. The first part focuses on the diffusion. The second part adds recovery. The readings for this section consist of two excerpts from the book I'm writing on models. One covers diffusion. The other covers tips. There is also a technical paper on tipping points that I've included in a link. I wrote it with PJ Lamberson and it will be published in the Quarterly Journal of Political Science. I've included this to provide you a glimpse of what technical social science papers look like. You don't need to read it in full, but I strongly recommend the introduction. It also contains a wonderful reference list. In this section, we cover some models of problem solving to show the role that diversity plays in innovation. We see how diverse perspectives (problem representations) and heuristics enable groups of problem solvers to outperform individuals. We also introduce some new concepts like rugged landscapes and local optima. In the last lecture, we'll see the awesome power of recombination and how it contributes to growth. The readings for this chapters consist on an excerpt from my book The Difference courtesy of Princeton University Press. Models can help us to determine the nature of outcomes produced by a system: will the system produce an equilibrium, a cycle, randomness, or complexity? In this set of lectures, we cover Lyapunov Functions. These are a technique that will enable us to identify many systems that go to equilibrium. In addition, they enable us to put bounds on how quickly the equilibrium will be attained. In this set of lectures, we learn the formal definition of Lyapunov Functions and see how to apply them in a variety of settings. We also see where they don't apply and even study a problem where no one knows whether or not the system goes to equilibrium or not. In this set of lectures, we cover path dependence. We do so using some very simple urn models. The most famous of which is the Polya Process. These models are very simple but they enable us to unpack the logic of what makes a process path dependent. We also relate path dependence to increasing returns and to tipping points. The reading for this lecture is a paper that I wrote that is published in the Quarterly Journal of Political Science In this section, we first discuss randomness and its various sources. We then discuss how performance can depend on skill and luck, where luck is modeled as randomness. We then learn a basic random walk model, which we apply to the Efficient Market Hypothesis, the ideas that market prices contain all relevant information so that what's left is randomness. We conclude by discussing finite memory random walk model that can be used to model competition. The reading for this section is a paper on distinguishing skill from luck by Michael Mauboussin. In this section, we cover the Prisoners' Dilemma, Collective Action Problems and Common Pool Resource Problems. We begin by discussion the Prisoners' Dilemma and showing how individual incentives can produce undesirable social outcomes. We then cover seven ways to produce cooperation. Five of these will be covered in the paper by Nowak and Sigmund listed below. We conclude by talking about collective action and common pool resource problems and how they require deep careful thinking to solve. There's a wonderful piece to read on this by the Nobel Prize winner Elinor Ostrom. In this section, we cover replicator dynamics and Fisher's fundamental theorem. Replicator dynamics have been used to explain learning as well as evolution. Fisher's theorem demonstrates how the rate of adaptation increases with the amount of variation. We conclude by describing how to make sense of both Fisher's theorem and our results on six sigma and variation reduction. The readings for this section are very short. The second reading on Fisher's theorem is rather technical. Both are excerpts from Diversity and Complexity. The description goes here ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:3h:1|2;Java

After completing this module, you will be able to… • Explain how money can motivate some workers. • Identify key managerial concerns if workers are self-interested and view work economically. • Develop strategies for addressing these key concerns using insights from economics. Welcome to the third module of this course! We'll be focusing on the non-monetary reasons for working, and the lessons for managers that result. After completing this module, you will be able to… • Explain  at least four different reasons that people work not related to money. • Identify key managerial concerns when workers work for different  non-monetary reasons.• Develop strategies for addressing these key concerns using insights from psychology and sociology. • Justify the (in)application of insights from economics, psychology, and sociology in different situations.  Welcome to the fourth and final module of this course! In this section, we'll finish laying a foundation for managing human resources by looking at the constraints faced by managers, especially the legal environment. After completing this module, you will be able to… • Explain at least four constraints that influence how human resources are managed in a particular organization. • Compare the ways in which the law does and does not see employment as a typical contractual relationship. • Create a list of legal and illegal HRM practices in your country. • Judge when to use strategies for managing people that go beyond what the law requires. Do you have people reporting to you that need managing? Or perhaps you want to consider a career in human resources? Or freshen up your HR knowledge? This specialization provides a robust introduction to the key principles, policies, and practices of human resource management. The specialization begins with a foundational course that considers alternative approaches to managing human resources, provides a background to the U.S. legal context in which employees are hired, fired, rewarded, and managed, and outlines the different reasons that people are motivated to work. The remaining three courses tackle three core areas that all managers should understand: hiring employees, evaluating their performance, and rewarding them. Throughout the courses, an accessible, scientific approach is embraced such that best practices and practical tips are informed by research, but presented in accessible, applied ways.  Upon completing the specialization, learners will have a deeper understanding of what works in the workplace, including a toolkit of best practices for hiring, managing, and rewarding employees.  The specialization will be valuable for managers and entrepreneurs taking on these responsibilities as well as anyone else interested in the fundamental principles of human resource management. The Capstone Project will provide an opportunity to apply this knowledge to a real situation, including your own organization or work unit if desired. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:14h:1|2;Java

The primary audience for this course is anyone who is interested in learning about race/racism in the US who has never taken a course in critical race or ethnic studies or affiliated fields (indeed, who may not know what the fields of critical race studies or ethnic studies are), who has never read a book about race/racism, or attended any race equity or diversity trainings on the topic of race/racism. In this course you will learn how to:  - Use and comprehend contemporary intersectional terminology through a provided glossary - Critically discuss “whiteness” - Recognize the concept of White privilege that all White people have whether they want that privilege or not and to differentiate between White supremacy as a systemic concept vs. White supremacists (who are professional racists like the KKK). - Distinguish between being not racist and being anti-racist - Define systemic and institutional racism  - Accept the unequal history of race and racism in the United States that has created racial hierarchies that has disenfranchised Black Americans - Share with others the true foundations of United States’s histories beginning with the acknowledgement of settler colonialism and the rewards that White people have received due to White supremacy and Black oppression. - Talk about race and racism - Explain why phrases like “All Lives Matter” and “Blue Lives Matter” are racist - Recognize that anyone can be anti-racist--it only takes the dedication and decision to be anti-racist, to educate yourself about the history of racism in the US and then to talk in an anti-racist way and to act as an anti-racist  Course logo image credit: Liam Edwards, 06/04/2021.

As one of 34 U.S. public institutions in the prestigious Association of American Universities (AAU), we have a proud tradition of academic excellence, with five Nobel laureates and more than 50 members of prestigious academic academies. This week you will learn various ways of defining race through definitions of whiteness. While race and racism have, in popular discourse, been understood to refer to non-white people, we start with whiteness since whiteness has been the primary ideology that dominated the formation of the United States, its laws, power structure, society, and culture. The anti-racism glossary also provides a variety of definitions related to race, racism, and anti-racism. Now that you've learned to define whiteness and other terms related to race, racism, and anti-racism, this week focuses on identifying the impact of race, racism, and anti-racism. The first article contextualizes our current moment of racial crisis, along with identifying differences between being not-racist and anti-racist. The remaining readings and viewings provide historical context for systemic racism, especially anti-Black racism in the US. For this final week of the anti-racism course you will see how the application of these terms and concepts are tied to other overlapping oppressions and how they can be used for specific anti-racism work, such as defunding the police (and why this is not as radical as people may think it is, though in many ways to imagine an anti-racist world is a radical act) and specific actions that each of us can do to be anti-racism allies and educators. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:11h:1|2;Java

We will learn about the philosophy of the Bayesian approach as well as how to implement it for common types of data. We will compare the Bayesian approach to the more commonly-taught Frequentist approach, and see some of the benefits of the Bayesian approach. In particular, the Bayesian approach allows for better accounting of uncertainty, results that have more intuitive and interpretable meaning, and more explicit statements of assumptions. This course combines lecture videos, computer demonstrations, readings, exercises, and discussion boards to create an active learning experience. For computing, you have the choice of using Microsoft Excel or the open-source, freely available statistical package R, with equivalent content for both options. The lectures provide some of the basic mathematical development as well as explanations of philosophy and interpretation. Completion of this course will give you an understanding of the concepts of the Bayesian approach, understanding the key differences between Bayesian and Frequentist approaches, and the ability to do basic data analyses.

It’s a place that connects people and programs in unexpected ways while providing unparalleled opportunities for students to learn through hands-on experience. In this module, we review the basics of probability and Bayes’ theorem. In Lesson 1, we introduce the different paradigms or definitions of probability and discuss why probability provides a coherent framework for dealing with uncertainty. In Lesson 2, we review the rules of conditional probability and introduce Bayes’ theorem. Lesson 3 reviews common probability distributions for discrete and continuous random variables. This module introduces concepts of statistical inference from both frequentist and Bayesian perspectives. Lesson 4 takes the frequentist view, demonstrating maximum likelihood estimation and confidence intervals for binomial data. Lesson 5 introduces the fundamentals of Bayesian inference. Beginning with a binomial likelihood and prior probabilities for simple hypotheses, you will learn how to use Bayes’ theorem to update the prior with data to obtain posterior probabilities. This framework is extended with the continuous version of Bayes theorem to estimate continuous model parameters, and calculate posterior probabilities and credible intervals. In this module, you will learn methods for selecting prior distributions and building models for discrete data. Lesson 6 introduces prior selection and predictive distributions as a means of evaluating priors. Lesson 7 demonstrates Bayesian analysis of Bernoulli data and introduces the computationally convenient concept of conjugate priors. Lesson 8 builds a conjugate model for Poisson data and discusses strategies for selection of prior hyperparameters. This module covers conjugate and objective Bayesian analysis for continuous data. Lesson 9 presents the conjugate model for exponentially distributed data. Lesson 10 discusses models for normally distributed data, which play a central role in statistics. In Lesson 11, we return to prior selection and discuss ‘objective’ or ‘non-informative’ priors. Lesson 12 presents Bayesian linear regression with non-informative priors, which yield results comparable to those of classical regression. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:7h:1|2;Java

With the recent introduction of high-quality-low-cost software and hardware, the tools of music production are now available to the masses. Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, dedication, and creativity.      Knowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.  Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing.   We will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process.       Once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),  a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide.   After editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board—a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.      In the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience. You bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen.

We need to interact with people around us, to make sense of the world and to position ourselves in a wider social and cultural reality. In this course, we look at how and why communication evolved as a science and reflect on today’s dominant paradigms. The course also extends beyond the boundaries of communication science itself, exploring dimensions of history, sociology and psychology. Join our class, together with people all over the world. Introduction to Communication Science explores some of the basic theories, models and concepts from the fields of mass, interpersonal and intrapersonal communication. The course begins with a consideration of several basic models, subsequently progressing to the history of communication theory, linear effect-oriented theories, the reception approach and, finally, exploring theories on the production and reinforcement of culture through communication.   Upon completion of this course, students should: • have knowledge of the history and development of communication science  • have knowledge of the dominant theoretical approaches within communication science  • have knowledge and understanding of the most important models and concepts in this field.

If you haven’t written any or many songs, this course will show you an efficient, effective process for tailoring songs to express your ideas and emotions. If you have, you’ll look at your process differently, taking control of aspects of the process you may have not noticed.  The course will start by examining the tools available to you, all revolving around the essential concept of prosody. You’ll learn to use your tools to enhance your message—to work compositionally at the same time you’re developing your ideas.  You’ll be working both lyrically and musically, though musically it’s not necessary that you either read music or play an instrument. If you play, great, and you’ll be encouraged to play and record your musical responses to the assignments. If you don’t play, the course offers you a number of musical loops to work with. All you’ll have to do is sing your melodies over the loops.  Assignments will ask you to post something for peer review—sometimes lyric lines or sections, sometimes melodies, sometimes both. None of it has to be polished. The course is about writing, not performing.  Most important, you’ll have a lot of fun.

This 12-lesson course covers an interdisciplinary field of study focusing on the physical, biological, and human dimensions of mountain places in Alberta, Canada, and around the world. Specifically, we'll study the geological origins of mountains, how they’re built-up and worn-down over time we’ll learn about their importance for biodiversity and water cycles, globally and locally we’ll explore their cultural significance to societies around the globe, and how that relationship has evolved over time and we’ll learn how mountains are used, how they’re protected, and how today they’re experiencing rapid change in a warming climate.  At the end of each lesson, Mountains 101 will also provide learners with some smart tricks -- Tech Tips -- to safely enjoy time in the high alpine environment: from how to pick the best footwear for hiking to making smart decisions in avalanche terrain.   We’ll be delivering your online lessons from valley bottoms to mountaintops, from museums and labs, to alpine huts and other spectacular alpine sites, and we’ll do so with the help of a whole host of experts.   We invite you to join us for this online adventure! The mountains are calling...

As one of Canada’s top universities, we’re known for excellence across the humanities, sciences, creative arts, business, engineering and health sciences. In this introductory lesson, you will learn why mountain environments are relevant to people all around the globe. We’ll also define just what a “mountain” is in order to show why it is useful to think about mountains from various perspectives. TechTip: Your feet are your vehicle In Lesson 2, we discuss why mountains are located where they are. How did they get there? We’ll explore the physical origins of mountains, theories of mountain building, and how our changing ideas about mountains and their genesis have shaped our engagement with them. TechTip: Dress for success Mountains influence climate and weather at both global and local scales. In Lesson 3, we will examine how elevation affects atmospheric processes, and discuss an ecological manifestation of mountain climate: the alpine tree line. TechTip: What goes in your pack? Lesson 4 explores some of the physiological responses that allow humans to visit higher altitudes, as well as the unique genetic adaptations that permit long-time exposure to the world’s high places. TechTip: Stay found – preparation Lesson 5 focuses on mountain hydrology. We'll discuss the ways that water moves through the mountain landscape, how water shapes and changes mountain landscapes, and we'll introduce some hazards associated with water, such as glacial lake outburst floods. TechTip: Stay found – in the field  Lesson 6 focuses exclusively on glaciers, their physical composition and processes, how they form and move, and how they modify the landscape. We’ll also examine how our changing understandings of glaciers have shaped the ways people have engaged with mountain landscapes over the past few centuries. TechTip: Stay safe – from falling  In Lesson 7, we examine some of the ways people have imagined mountains throughout time, and try to place those ideas and attitudes in their respective cultural contexts. Appreciating the diversity of views – their reception in oral traditions, art, literature, architecture, and other cultural forms – gives us some context for the more dominant ways we think about and celebrate mountains today. TechTip: Stay safe – winter challenges  Mountain hazards are the focus of Lesson 8, specifically snow avalanches, landslides, and volcanoes. We will examine the physical processes that lead to instability in mountain landscapes and consider how risks associated with hazards can be managed. TechTip: Stay safe – avalanche safety (know before you go)  In this Lesson 9, we discuss the ecological and evolutionary processes that account for the remarkable biodiversity of species living in mountain environments. Then, we explore some of the unique adaptations that plants have for coping with extreme conditions, including cold, intense solar radiation, and short growing seasons. TechTip: Go farther – camping  Animals living in mountains have evolved morphological, behavioural, and physiological adaptations to survive under extreme conditions. In Lesson 10, we will focus on how several species deal with the cold and conclude with a peek at the adaptations of fish living in mountain lakes. TechTip: Go farther – cooking How are mountains used? How are they preserved? In Lesson 11, we examine the often conflicting demands of using mountains, and preserving and managing the integrity of mountain environments, cultures and economies. TechTip: Go softly – mountain ethics  In Lesson 12, we will look forward and consider some possible future scenarios for mountains. How is our changing climate affecting these places? What are the indicators of change? What lessons can we learn from the past and present to inform decisions for tomorrow? ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:46h:1|2;Java

Have you forgotten the grammar you once studied? If so, this course is perfect for you.  The first course in this specialization is a refresher on some tools needed for good writing. It will help prepare you for the other courses. You will need about 10 hours to complete this first course. Writing is a skill and to learn a skill well, you need to practice. In this course, you will watch short video lectures and then practice and discuss what you have learned. Make sure you take good notes and use the peer discussions to ask questions. Then you'll be able to remember the rules you learn in this course when you start writing essays in the next course.  After completing this course, you will be able to:  - identify the correct verb tenses to use  - use commas effectively  - utilize several different sentence types  - write more effectively in English  Please note that the free version of this class gives you access to all of the instructional videos and handouts. The peer feedback and quizzes are only available in the paid version.

UCI’s unyielding commitment to rigorous academics, cutting-edge research, and leadership and character development makes the campus a driving force for innovation and discovery that serves our local, national and global communities in many ways. This is the first course in the Academic English: Writing specialization, which will help prepare you for studying in an American college or university. This first course will go over some of the basics of grammar and punctuation that you'll need to do good writing. It is not intended to review all aspects of English grammar, only the few topics chosen for this class. In this short module, to get started, introduce yourself and get to know the other learners a little bit. In the following lessons, you will watch video lectures, do readings, do practice exercises, and take quizzes. To pass the course, just pass all three quizzes. When you finish one activity, then go on to the next one. Enjoy the class! In this module, you will watch video lectures, do readings, do practice exercises, and take quizzes. You can re-watch the videos or redo the exercises as many times as you need to to help you understand the material. This module will help you review verb tenses and how to use them correctly. You probably already studied these in your other English classes, so this will just be a quick reminder. Then you'll begin learning about how to use conjunctions in your sentences. This will help you write different kinds of sentences and make your writing more interesting. Now that you've learned about conjunctions, you're ready to learn about different types of sentences. In English, there are four types of sentences that you can use--and should use--to make your writing more interesting to read. In this module, you'll learn about two of the advanced sentence types. In this module, you'll learn some other uses for commas. After studying this module, you'll know about 95% of the ways commas can be used. That means you'll be able to write confidently, knowing that you are using commas correctly and not just guessing. In addition to learning about commas, you'll learn about creating parallel structure and sentence variety. When you add these to your writing tools, your writing will be even more effective. The skills taught in this Specialization will empower you to succeed in any college-level course or professional field. You’ll learn to conduct rigorous academic research and to express your ideas clearly in an academic format. In the final Capstone Project, all the knowledge that you’ve gained over the span of these courses will culminate into an academic research paper on an issue of your choice. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:14h:1|2;Java

This course will allow you to acquire elements from engineering science, sociology, environmental science, political science, economics, management science, in order to evaluate, analyze and implement the diffusion of electric vehicles where their use is relevant.  This MOOC is the English version of Mobilités et véhicules électriques in the lecture videos, the teachers speak in French, nevertheless their presentation is in English and English subtitles are available.  Groupe Renault and ParisTech schools have been working together for almost 15 years on topics related to sustainable mobility. Together, they created two Master programs (Transport and Sustainable Development in 2004, Mobility and Electric Vehicles in 2010) and the Sustainable Mobility Institute Renault-ParisTech in 2009, to support ongoing changes. Electric Vehicles and Mobility is the result of this shared history and was developed from a course delivered within the Master Mobility and Electric Vehicles, led by Arts et Métiers ParisTech in partnership with Ensta ParisTech, Mines ParisTech and École des Ponts ParisTech. Subtitles: English, French Subtitles: English, French École des Ponts ParisTech, may be France’s oldest engineering school (since 1747), but it remains young and very much in the present, as it has always been, in training talented, innovative future leaders in order to transform today’s realities and build tomorrow’s world in key areas of day-to-day life, such as transport, housing, and urban services, and also in foundational fields like energy, environment, climate sciences, spatial planning or sustainable development… We are happy to welcome you to be part of our community of students and senior executives whom are offered the best experience in terms of excellence and open minded approach to Elite Higher and Executive education. <p>A few words about the course and how it works.</p><p>We kick off this course with a video presentation of <em>Electric Vehicles and Mobility</em>.

We will then discuss the evolution of vehicle connectivity and explore the opportunities that it presents for the deployment of the electric vehicle. We will clarify the distinction among the different levels of vehicle automation through a video <em>Do you know that?</em>.</p><p>The course is enriched by an interview of an expert from Groupe Renault who discusses various examples of experiments with automated electric vehicles.</p><p>The graded assessment for chapters 7 and 8 will be found in the section following chapter 8.</p> <p>Introducing this MOOC, we asked whether electric vehicle is only for rich people in 'the North'. This chapter explicitly aims to help you to build your answers to this question. It will first discuss the possible diffusion of the electric vehicle in the Bottom-Of-Pyramid markets, that is to say the poorest (though, unfortunately, most numerous) population categories. It will then discuss the possibility for the countries in 'the South' to go straight to electric mobility, without going through the same historical development of thermal mobility as the one that countries in the North have experienced. We will therefore analyze the conditions of a leapfrogging in the field of mobility like that which has been operated in the telecommunications field where the cellular phone has been deployed in countries that have never deployed an extensive wired network.</p><p>A last interview of an expert from Groupe Renault will conclude this course on a discussion of the business model of the electric vehicle that would allow mobility for all.</p><p>Finally, you will find the graded assessment for both chapter 7 and 8 in the following section.

Only 15% leave because they feel they are not good enough. Almost 70% leave because they were not having fun, or due to problems with the coach. Injuries cause 30% to give up sports. This course is packed full of practical sports science information that provide youth coaches and parents with the practical pediatric sports science insights to successfully retain young athletes and develop their sport potential while avoiding injury and overtraining. We begin by examining the multidimensional nature of coaching, the relevant sport motor performance abilities, the impact of growth and development on motor skills, the gene versus practice controversy, and briefly overview the body structures strengthened through training. Then we explore the athlete's energy supply, where this energy comes from, and how it matures along with the athlete. Finally, we examine the development of strength, power, anaerobic capacity, coordination and flexibility through the life span.

Youth coaches who have a sound understanding of pediatric sports science are essential to the successful development of a young athlete’s sport potential. In this section you are introduced to the multidimensional nature of coaching, and how an athlete’s motor abilities of endurance, strength, speed, coordination and flexibility are affected by growth and maturation. The manual is available in the Resource Section. Many factors can positively and negatively impact the young athlete’s ability to optimize their sports potential.  In this section we examine strategies for ensuring the athlete’s systematic long-term sports development and how to mold the correct sport-specific phenotype. The coach is a microbiologist who designs training so it stimulates the body’s cells and structures to become stronger and more efficient. In this section you are introduced to key organ systems, and the energy these organ systems use to run the chemical reactions needed for a sports performance. You will also learn how diet can positively enhance an athlete’s ability to train and compete. The level of expertise with which an athlete is able to perform sports skill depends on how well the coach molds the correct ratio of endurance, strength, power and speed to meet the demands of the sport. In this section you will learn the science behind developing these important motor performance abilities as the young athlete moves through puberty. Coordination and flexibility permit movements that are precise, fluid and spatially controlled. In this section we examine current knowledge about coordination and flexibility as the young child moves through early childhood and into adolescence. ;0;1;1;Długość kursu:28h:1|2;Java

In this course you will learn the basics of statistics not just how to calculate them, but also how to evaluate them. This course will also prepare you for the next course in the specialization - the course Inferential Statistics.  In the first part of the course we will discuss methods of descriptive statistics. You will learn what cases and variables are and how you can compute measures of central tendency (mean, median and mode) and dispersion (standard deviation and variance). Next, we discuss how to assess relationships between variables, and we introduce the concepts correlation and regression.   The second part of the course is concerned with the basics of probability: calculating probabilities, probability distributions and sampling distributions. You need to know about these things in order to understand how inferential statistics work.   The third part of the course consists of an introduction to methods of inferential statistics - methods that help us decide whether the patterns we see in our data are strong enough to draw conclusions about the underlying population we are interested in. We will discuss confidence intervals and significance tests.  You will not only learn about all these statistical concepts, you will also be trained to calculate and generate these statistics yourself using freely available statistical software.

Today, with more than 39,000 students, 5,000 staff and 285 study programmes (Bachelor's and Master's), many of which are taught in English, and a budget of more than 600 million euros, it is one of the largest comprehensive universities in Europe. It is a member of the League of European Research Universities and also maintains intensive contact with other leading research universities around the world. In this module we'll consider the basics of statistics. But before we start, we'll give you a broad sense of what the course is about and how it's organized. Are you new to Coursera or still deciding whether this is the course for you? Then make sure to check out the 'Course introduction' and 'What to expect from this course' sections below, so you'll have the essential information you need to decide and to do well in this course! If you have any questions about the course format, deadlines or grading, you'll probably find the answers here. Are you a Coursera veteran and ready to get started? Then you might want to skip ahead to the first course topic: 'Exploring data'. You can always check the general information later. Veterans and newbies alike: Don't forget to introduce yourself in the 'meet and greet' forum! In this first module, we’ll introduce the basic concepts of descriptive statistics. We’ll talk about cases and variables, and we’ll explain how you can order them in a so-called data matrix. We’ll discuss various levels of measurement and we’ll show you how you can present your data by means of tables and graphs. We’ll also introduce measures of central tendency (like mode, median and mean) and dispersion (like range, interquartile range, variance and standard deviation). We’ll not only tell you how to interpret them we’ll also explain how you can compute them. Finally, we’ll tell you more about z-scores. In this module we’ll only discuss situations in which we analyze one single variable. This is what we call univariate analysis. In the next module we will also introduce studies in which more variables are involved. In this second module we’ll look at bivariate analyses: studies with two variables. First we’ll introduce the concept of correlation. We’ll investigate contingency tables (when it comes to categorical variables) and scatterplots (regarding quantitative variables). We’ll also learn how to understand and compute one of the most frequently used measures of correlation: Pearson's r. In the next part of the module we’ll introduce the method of OLS regression analysis. We’ll explain how you (or the computer) can find the regression line and how you can describe this line by means of an equation. We’ll show you that you can assess how well the regression line fits your data by means of the so-called r-squared. We conclude the module with a discussion of why you should always be very careful when interpreting the results of a regression analysis.      This module introduces concepts from probability theory and the rules for calculating with probabilities. This is not only useful for answering various kinds of applied statistical questions but also to understand the statistical analyses that will be introduced in subsequent modules. We start by describing randomness, and explain how random events surround us. Next, we provide an intuitive definition of probability through an example and relate this to the concepts of events, sample space and random trials. A graphical tool to understand these concepts is introduced here as well, the tree-diagram.Thereafter a number of concepts from set theory are explained and related to probability calculations. Here the relation is made to tree-diagrams again, as well as contingency tables. We end with a lesson where conditional probabilities, independence and Bayes rule are explained. All in all, this is quite a theoretical module on a topic that is not always easy to grasp. That's why we have included as many intuitive examples as possible. Probability distributions form the core of many statistical calculations. They are used as mathematical models to represent some random phenomenon and subsequently answer statistical questions about that phenomenon. This module starts by explaining the basic properties of a probability distribution, highlighting how it quantifies a random variable and also pointing out how it differs between discrete and continuous random variables. Subsequently the cumulative probability distribution is introduced and its properties and usage are explained as well. In a next lecture it is shown how a random variable with its associated probability distribution can be characterized by statistics like a mean and variance, just like observational data. The effects of changing random variables by multiplication or addition on these statistics are explained as well.The lecture thereafter introduces the normal distribution, starting by explaining its functional form and some general properties. Next, the basic usage of the normal distribution to calculate probabilities is explained. And in a final lecture the binomial distribution, an important probability distribution for discrete data, is introduced and further explained. By the end of this module you have covered quite some ground and have a solid basis to answer the most frequently encountered statistical questions. Importantly, the fundamental knowledge about probability distributions that is presented here will also provide a solid basis to learn about inferential statistics in the next modules. Methods for summarizing sample data are called descriptive statistics. However, in most studies we’re not interested in samples, but in underlying populations. If we employ data obtained from a sample to draw conclusions about a wider population, we are using methods of inferential statistics. It is therefore of essential importance that you know how you should draw samples. In this module we’ll pay attention to good sampling methods as well as some poor practices. To draw conclusions about the population a sample is from, researchers make use of a probability distribution that is very important in the world of statistics: the sampling distribution. We’ll discuss sampling distributions in great detail and compare them to data distributions and population distributions. We’ll look at the sampling distribution of the sample mean and the sampling distribution of the sample proportion.  We can distinguish two types of statistical inference methods. We can: (1) estimate population parameters and (2) test hypotheses about these parameters. In this module we’ll talk about the first type of inferential statistics: estimation by means of a confidence interval. A confidence interval is a range of numbers, which, most likely, contains the actual population value. The  probability that the interval actually contains the population value is what we call the confidence level. In this module we’ll show you how you can construct confidence intervals for means and proportions and how you should interpret them. We’ll also pay attention to how you can decide how large your sample size should be. In this module we’ll talk about statistical hypotheses. They form the main ingredients of the method of significance testing. An hypothesis is nothing more than an expectation about a population. When we conduct a significance test, we use (just like when we construct a confidence interval) sample data to draw inferences about population parameters. The significance test is, therefore, also a method of inferential statistics. We’ll show that each significance test is based on two hypotheses:  the null hypothesis and  the alternative hypothesis. When you do a significance test, you assume that the null hypothesis is true unless your data provide strong evidence against it. We’ll show you how you can conduct a significance test about a mean and how you can conduct a test about a proportion. We’ll also demonstrate that significance tests and confidence intervals are closely related. We conclude the module by arguing that you can make right and wrong decisions while doing a test. Wrong decisions are referred to as Type I and Type II errors. This is the final module, where you can apply everything you've learned until now in the final exam. Please note that you can only take the final exam once a month, so make sure you are fully prepared to take the test. Please follow the honor code and do not communicate or confer with others while taking this exam. Good luck!  Identify interesting questions, analyze data sets, and correctly interpret results to make solid, evidence-based decisions. This Specialization covers research methods, design and statistical analysis for social science research questions. In the final Capstone Project, you’ll apply the skills you learned by developing your own research question, gathering data, and analyzing and reporting on the results using statistical methods. ;10;1;1;Długość kursu:30h:1|2;Java
